Something I wished I learned a lot
sooner in my golf game is how the down
swing really works. Now, there's many
different videos on the down swing, but
nothing really talks about this concept.
And once I understood this concept, my
swing speed went through the roof, my
contact improved, and I was able to fix
my swing flaws quickly without a lot of
issue. And we're looking at something
that I'm just going to call the throw
angle. and it is one of the single most
important concepts in the golf swing.
The throw angle is how the club
propels out to the ball in the down
swing. So we have in the down swing a
component called shaft angle. And then
we have another component which is the
lead arm moving
down toward the target and post impact.
And in the process of this lead arm
moving out toward the target, or you can
think of it as a lead arm moving off of
my chest.
In this process, the club is thrown
outward. And it looks very much like a
motion you would see in a throw or a
bounce pass with a basketball. We can
throw the club at many different angles.
I can have a very vertical swing and
throw the club down.
I can have a very shallow swing and
throw the club out a lot.
Or I can have a swing in the middle
somewhere where we want to be and throw
the club down and out toward the target.
And the most powerful way to hit a golf
ball is we're hitting down and out
toward the target for the straightest
shot with the most effortless feeling
swing.
A simple way to feel this throw angle is
to take an alignment stick.
And with this alignment stick, I just
want you to bounce pass out toward the
target. So go in the top of my back
swing. And as I accelerate my shoulders,
I should hear a whoosh out after where
the golf ball would be. If you're
throwing your whoosh behind the ball,
then you are throwing at too steep of an
angle. And here's something that's
really cool, and you may not have heard
this before. You You can actually throw
a steep angle in an over-the-top swing.
the most common.
Or you can throw with the club staying
too far behind you.
And in both cases, I have a steep throw
angle. And they both lead to a lot of
frustration.
You notice how these clubs bottom out
behind the ball consistently.
And if you saw me with a club, you would
see a lot of standing up. There's
another concept of the throw.
Losing speed, losing contact. My world
is ending. The squirrels are going to
say hello to my ball in the woods.
Yet, when we take this throw angle,
instead of launching the arm down, we
launch around. Look at what immediately
just changed there. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold your horses. Throwing it down.
Throwing it out.
Look at the speed difference in that.
Can't get speed there. I can get speed
there.
I feel like I'm on that most most
extreme elimination challenge impact
replay. And I'm I'm the captain.
You know, comment if you got that
reference, by the way. Shows you where
my sense of humor has been since I was a
child. But the throw angle for a really
powerful swing is one that involves you
having the angle of the club, let's just
say 45 degrees here generically cuz it's
going to be different for driver
shallower wedge is going to be steeper.
Just for demonstration purposes, just
say 45° too steep, too shallow, just
right.
If I take this lead arm and move it out
toward the target instead of just going
down, I will see more speed and my
shoulder moves toward the target as
well.
In your swing, you're moving that arm
too much down
and that's where all your frustration
lies. This goes for expert players as
well as beginners and intermediates.
Everybody could benefit from this throw
angle understanding.
So after making a few swings with that
alignment stick, I now have a sense of
where do I throw the club and you should
be learning right now saying I have to
think about my back swing first before I
even get to the down swing. And that is
the one of the most important pieces
right there is like I could change my
back swing and I could throw the club
differently.
So, if I have a back swing that's very
across the line and I attempt to throw,
that's the throw angle. Look at the lead
arm. If I move it off the chest at all.
So, this is why you can't be consistent
from this position. You have to then
unwind and then throw.
You're going to try to figure out this
throw angle. Your brain is very smart.
It will get the club as best it can into
this position. For an across the line
steep top type of back swing type
person, usually they'll do over and
across, which doesn't help or they'll
unwind by throwing their hips out toward
the target and hooking it and pushing it
all day long and chunking it.
or the person. So, so, so a steep back
swing position
requires you to think about your down
swing more, requires a lot more brain
power.
It requires a lot more efficiency. It is
a slowdown.
And yeah, this is where the you could
say, oh, well, such and such player had
a steeper back at the top. They made it
work. Yes, there are many players in
history who have made that work for
them.
I am actually one of those players and I
don't like it because you can feel the
inefficiency of having to do this.
That's why I want to encourage you
to think about your type of back swing
position as being the throw angle.
And that's why I want your throw angle
to be 45° at the top.
Because then from here, there is nothing
but perfect efficiency through. Nothing
to slow down the shoulders, nothing to
slow down your body.
The challenge of the throw angle is that
it feels really weird.
That's the one thing that makes this so
hard. But you learn this today. The rest
of your golfing life gets so much
simpler.
So to get a shallow throw angle at the
top,
we just need to think about keeping the
trail arm in an under position.
Or by under I mean that it is tucked in
or rotated externally rotated. Palm
faces guy, forearm faces this guy. And
from this position you have a perfect
throw angle. This would be perfect. If
I'm on a level level playing field like
a baseball player, that's perfection.
The fastest the shoulders can move is
when the club head and the shoulders and
the arm are all in this inline
relationship on that same plane.
Inefficiencies would happen in a swing
if I had to do this in a baseball swing
or this, which I'd never really do.
Everything is working efficiently on
that one plane.
Power is optimized. So in the golf
swing, we tilt it down. My shoulders and
club and arm working on that same plane
is the most efficient throw out to the
ball. Everything working on that same
line.
Now, I say this
and I act like it's it's really easy to
do. It's not.
But if we got there,
we'd have the most perfect powerful
swing. And that's why many golfers of
our generation today are getting into a
top of action position that looks a lot
like this. Because they've optimized
that throw, they can go right back out
to the ball.
So, I'm going to tuck my trail arm in.
at setup to the point where it's facing
out. Next thing I want to do is make
sure that I can swing this shoulder
around my body while keeping it tucked
in.
This feels really weird. And for most
people with a steeper back swing,
they're going to feel this. That's okay.
You have to feel this to get that really
perfect throw.
And here's how you know you've got a
great throwing angle. Go to the top of
your current back swing. Just go there
and then move your lead arm off
toward off your body toward the target
like you're swinging a pendulum.
If it's too steep,
you're hitting behind the ball. If it's
too shallow, you're going to completely
miss the ground. If it's just right,
you're going to hit the ground. You're
going to see a brushing out in front
with a free moving shoulder.
That's the position you need to get
into. I'm going to reverse engineer my
swing. Thinking backwards. Okay, that's
what I felt in that one arm swing. So,
I'm going to get here at the top and
throw
out. Allow it to throw.
I'm not going down anymore. I'm going
out toward the target.
The only way I can do this is by feeling
that palm and that arm facing away from
my body throughout the swing. After
feeling the correct throw angle,
tuck my arm in, go to the top of my back
swing with two hands on the club, and I
see that's the correct angle. I'm just
moving my lead arm only.
I can see that I can throw out and I'm
not getting running into this problem
of hitting behind the ball, throwing the
arm down. I need to throw the arm out
and around
that type of feeling.
I hit behind that one a little bit
because I fight this in my own swing. I
fight want to pull down with the arm. I
need to keep it moving out and around.
So, keep the trail arm tucked in. There
we go. I move that lead arm more around.
Nothing slowed it down. Much better
strike and swing. And for me, if you're
watching this and you see my club get a
little too steep at the top or even a
little across the line, that is my own
swing defect. And it is a result of not
want not keeping this in as much as I
want to. I fight this arm. just keeps
untucking on me. It's so annoying.
We have to feel the opposite. If we're
in that problem, keep tucking it more
and more to the top.
My throw angle has to be more out, not
down.
That's how I can hit a solid shot
with more speed.
Oh, that's beautiful. Beautiful throw.
You'll know you're doing it right when
you see
at the top that it's a shallower angle.
And then when you're swinging into the
ball, the club spends less time going
down. It spends more time going to the
ball.
That would be the most direct path to
the ball. If at any point it's going
down too much, you are having having an
inefficiency. Your throw angle is is
off. It's off. The back swing needs to
be fixed somewhere or you need to work
on getting more over with this arm.
That was perfect. That was ta That was
so tasty. I can't get enough of that
golf shot.
Sometimes I will go to the range and
I'll just stand here and do this because
I know I want to go here and this way.
So I make sure the club keeps going out
on that arm out and I feel the shoulder
the shoulder moves as a result of the
arm. So the arm accelerates, the
shoulder accelerates, moves around my
body.
It is one of the most freeing feelings.
It feels like just air, a ton of air
whooshing out in front of me.
And I'll be doing another episode on
this where I talk about the effect on
your swing speed. This is what added
almost 10 mph of club head speed for all
my clubs in the bag. This concept of the
throw angle.
And let's say I'm teaching a beginner
and it's like, Tom, well, this sounds
pretty complicated. If you're beginner,
intermediate, this sounds like it's a
new concept. Maybe it's hard to wrap
your mind around this at first. Yeah, we
might be diving a little bit more into
the details today.
And so, another way I would convey this
is just thinking about it from the
perspective of the alignment stick
drill.
you know that you're not throwing
correctly if at any point with this
drill you're back here. So you just have
to tell yourself how do I throw the
whoosh out in front of me and you would
find that doesn't happen from a steep
top of back swing happens rather from a
shallower top of back swing where I can
go out. So I don't have to explain these
details. You don't have to know all
these details.
I do think it's really important that
you know how this concept works.
But if you're a little confused, just go
back to alignment stick drill. You can
meditate on this a little bit later.
Take that med take that alignment stick
drill and then say, "Okay, I'll just do
it with a club now. I'm going to throw
it out."
Throwing it out. That's a really nice
strike. In fact, that that alignment
stick drill just helped me right there
with my own type of back swing problem.
Now I know what to work on. It's like
that's there and I got to throw it. Set
it in that position and throw it. Oh,
that was even better.
This Don't you love when your own drills
are working the way to fix your own
swing? That's a euphoric moment of
victory has been achieved today. That
was that was about the most centered
strike. Oh, I'll never forget that. It
works with a driver, too. Works every
club in the bag. You know, we could hit
a driver. Let's do it because someone
always comments that, "Hey, does it work
with a driver?" Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. It does.
Do not worry. Do not fear.
Same thing. You can see quickly with the
driver ah versus whoosh out here with
one arm. One arm whoosh just slinging
that club through. That feels great. I
might hit somebody's house at the end of
the range if I keep this up.
Oh my goodness. Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.
Oh, it's still there. It's still there.
Okay, that's too close to that house.
Too close. Okay, so I want to know your
thoughts on the throw angle. Comment
below. Let me know. I want to know if
this was a breakthrough for you. If it
helped you eliminate a lot of swing
flaws, because this does fix a lot of
swing flaws. It fixes almost every swing
flaw. If you were to completely neglect
your back swing, if you were to say, "I
don't want to think about my swing at
all, and the only thing you had to think
about was throw angle," you could still
do it. You don't have to have the
perfect swing.
You could be Jim Furick even, but he
gets you get into a throw angle
position.
However, that is a little bit
inefficient.
And I want to see you get into the
fastest possible swing for you. We can
hit the ball the farthest. So, it would
come down to how quickly can you get
into this efficient position and how
quickly can you unload it off and throw
everything out toward the target. Thanks
for watching today and I'll see you in a
future episode.
