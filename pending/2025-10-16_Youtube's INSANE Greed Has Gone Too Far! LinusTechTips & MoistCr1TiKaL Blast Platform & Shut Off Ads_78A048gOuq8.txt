Something is very weird. Something is ah
going on with YouTube and some of its
top creators. Uh Charlie, also known as
Moist Critical, as well as Lionus from
Lionus Tech Tips seemingly turning on
YouTube and their endless thirst for
monetization.
Look, I get it. Remember when you used
to watch this channel and there were
never any ads and there were there was
no coffee brand coffee that I would beg
you to buy and there was no mid rolls.
YouTube has made it and by the way I'm
making basically
less money than I was 3 years ago.
YouTube has continuously made it more
and more difficult for creators to earn
a living without getting direct support
from their viewers, which is incredibly
uh appreciated. And they pushed out this
members only thing where you could join
a YouTube channel as a member and then
people would create content behind a
payw wall and then you would get fear of
missing out and then you would pay the
content creator five bucks. Except
YouTube would take 30% of that. Every
time I have a call with like my YouTube
rep, it's never, hey, your thumbnails
are bad or hey, you need to title your
stuff differently to get more views.
It's always, hey, you need to demand
more money from your viewers. Jeremy,
you need to do you need to tell your
viewers about super thanks so they can
pay $10 to super chat you so you can see
it. You need to have super uh chats. Um,
you need to have a members area. By the
way, let me tell you about if you are a
member on this site, please transfer it
to thequartering.com/join.
It's the same amount of money. It's 100%
of it goes to me and my team and you get
to talk directly to me in the Discord
and you get to suggest topics to the
website.
Get your YouTube membership gone and
join on thequartering.com/join.
If you're a member of mine on locals or
if you're a member of mine on um you
know any of these other sites, move it
to the quartering.com/join.
If you don't even care about the
Discord, but you want to support the
channel, this is still better because I
get 100% of it. And um
I I too am going to turn off memberships
um after kind of considering this and
seeing what Charlie said. So hopefully
you'll do that, you know. And you don't
see any coffee ads in the members
Discord either. Um we also have a
Halloween contest going on right now. Uh
prizes for pumpkin carving, costumes,
movie watch parties, stuff like that.
But Lionus TechTips has disabled all of
his membersonly content on his YouTube
channel, blaming the features for
driving viewers away from his content.
Now, if you I have been getting served a
a Tim Pool membersonly video for like
the last the last like here's a bruisel
members only. I was I kept getting
served this membersonly video for Tim
Pool that was like four years old about
Star Wars and it was taking up valuable
real estate on this side. I finally had
to like request it to be hidden, but
they just replaced it with another one.
Um here's what Lionus says. Lus TechTips
says YouTube's new membership system is
cluttering feeds, spamming viewers, and
driving fans away so much that they've
disabled the fe uh the feature. That's
what I'm going to do also. So, if you
are a member or you support, you know,
go to the quarterin.comjoin, join today.
You can cancel your YouTube membership.
Lionus TechTips is shutting down
YouTube's membersonly videos after
blasting the platform's recent changes
to the feature. In a video on October
7th, Lionus said the YouTube's updated
system is a gross fear of missing out
sales strategy that's flooding
recommendations and making the site
unnavigable. I agree with that. I keep
getting served up membersonly videos of
people that I'm subscribed to. And look,
I get it.
You know, yes, the stock market's doing
well, but that's like 2% of the
population benefits when that happens.
Like, I tried to have stocks, but I
ended up selling everything because it
was stressing me out too much. You know,
the stock market's okay, great, but it's
still $40 for a USDA prime ribeye. You
know, it's expensive out there. And like
even me as a creator, I can't afford to
pay $5 to every creator to see their
membersonly videos. Um, and for whatever
reason, YouTube really started spamming
it. And it's it is gross. Uh, the
feature launched over 6 years ago is a
simple ways for viewers to create
supporters, which again I support. I
have I think a couple hundred members.
you get way more value in my Discord. I
very rarely upload members only videos,
but I'm always in there. We can talk and
hang out, play video games together,
watch movies together. I'm putting
someone in charge of that starting in
November, by the way. Um, and so they'll
be able to really get kind of the
gettogethers and stuff. People actually
get value, which is I've been feeling
really guilty about.
YouTube is quietly overhauled how it
works. It now pushes locked videos onto
homepages, search results, and suggested
feeds for viewers who can't even watch
them. This isn't a change that we would
have enabled if we were given a choice,
he said. We would have not signed up for
the program in the first place if we
knew this was coming. The most
frustrating part of all this is how
utterly lacking in self-awareness
YouTube seems to be here. To fix it,
Lionus mentioned that YouTube should add
some sort of option menu that allows
viewers to hide membersonly videos,
perhaps making it specific only to
premium members. I mean, it would be one
thing if there were mechanisms like
there are for the ads, subject matter,
or even creators to opt out of these
promotions as a viewer or if there were
exemptions for people who are already
paying for YouTube Premium, he said. But
at this time, no mechanisms exist. Uh,
and I've seen no indication from YouTube
that they plan to enable creators to go
back to controlling these promotions
themselves. Sebastian also confirmed his
team will begin removing or hiding every
paywalled upload from their channels.
Anyone who subscribed to that content
will receive a pro-rated refund, while
lower tier members with badges or emojis
will remain unaffected. He also cited
fellow YouTuber Dank Pods, who shared
similar complaints about the program,
saying YouTube's algorithm and lack of
creator control have made the feature
messy and frustrating for viewers.
Despite a spike in member signups since
the change, Sebastian said that the
system has damaged overall viewership,
community sentiment, it's killing
interest in our channel. This is one of
the things that I one of the big issues
I have with it is look what is what are
the percentage of my daily viewers.
Let's say I have about a 100,000 unique
viewers per day. Some days are higher,
some days are lower, but it's about
100,000.
Maybe 10% of them are even interested in
paying additional money. And some
percentage of that 10%
don't even have the extra money right
now because things are tough. And it's
actually making people have a negative
connotation of my channel cuz they think
I'm the one spamming it. Look, when I'm
telling you to go to coffeebrand
coffee.com and get some of my delicious
coffee, that's me and I can control
that. When I say, "Hey, please go to the
quartering.com/join and become a
member." I'm controlling that. So, if
you're on YouTube right now and you're
doing that, go over to the
quartering.com and become a member
because I'm going to be ending the I'm
going to be ending it. And you know it
it's not my choice but it's because
people are getting so nonsense
you know or people are getting annoyed
and I don't have any control on how much
I annoy them.
Now people are saying Lionus gets you
know gets greedy with YouTube
monetization. People start to leave.
Blames YouTube that people don't want to
pay for his halfbaked content. You know,
a lot of people are turning on
Lionus, but I don't think that that's
fair. I mean, there are legitimate
reasons to criticize Lionus, but I, as a
YouTube user, as somebody who pays for
YouTube Premium, even I'm getting
inundated with these premium only
videos, and I'm like, I don't want that.
I can't afford to pay, you know, to
support 10 channels, you know, just to
get their premium content all the time.
And it'd be one thing, everybody knows
it's there. Every content creator
mentions it, but it'd be one thing if it
was just there as a feature, but it's
not. It's getting crammed down
everyone's throats, which again, if you
haven't yet, cancel your YouTube
membership to me, uh, and go to the
quarterin.com and join. you get way more
value for the same amount of money and
it goes directly to me uh and my team as
opposed to you know uh YouTube getting
30% of it and even we see here Moyes
Critical Moyes Critical turns off all
monetization so viewers quote can't
waste their money now I don't know if
this means he turned off ads on his
YouTube videos but popular YouTuber and
Twitch streamer Moyes Critical has
turned off every form of monetization
possible and is urging viewers to hold
on to their money or donate to charity
Viewers donating large amounts of money
to streamers have always been a
controversial topic and it often makes
headlines. Earlier this month, a
streamer lost their life because a
viewer who had to a viewer who had sent
her nearly $70,000.
While some big names like Asol and
Techone have urged streamers to outright
ban viewers who send outrageous amounts,
Charlie Moyes Critical uh isn't even
letting it go that far. Instead, he's
making it impossible for fans to spend
their money on him. In a YouTube video
uploaded October 9th, the legendary
YouTube star explained that he disabled
every form of monetization possible,
including super chats and channel
memberships.
According to Charles, in addition to
turning off forms of all forms of
YouTube monetization on his channel, he
even raised the minimum bit donation on
Twitch to an amount so drastically high,
he hopes no one will ever be able to
spend that much. Once you opt in to a
partner program or whatever, you can't
turn off bits or subs, he explained. for
subs. I can't get rid of that. I could
if I would. I would say tootly do and
give a long slap on the rear on until
good game and goodbye. But from what I
can tell, there are a lot of hoops to
jump through in order to accomplish
that. At one point, Asenold streamed
exclusively to a new account. Now, I
don't have any problem with content
creators making money. Obviously,
someone as big as Charlie, who gets
three million views per video every
single day of the week, you know, he's
probably worth $50 million. Um, that
said, I still would not say, "Hey, you
have to turn off ads." But I do really
respect, um, you know, maybe one day
I'll make enough money that I can do
that. Um, according to Moyes, he'd
rather just have viewers hold on to
their money. However, for viewers who
have money burning a hole in their
pocket, he says, "Donate it to charity."
Um, I don't know. I don't know if Moyes
critical is, you know, I can't tell
because I have YouTube Premium. I can't
tell if he actually turned off ads too,
which would be bonkers. I'm trying to
see here. Uh, moist critical
penguin zero. Okay, let's see.
>> It's crazy to me that
>> Well, I didn't get an ad, so I don't
know. Maybe he did turn off ads, which
is wild. I wonder if YouTube will punish
them for that
because
for me when a video gets demonetized
>> Watkins
>> when video gets demonetized
YouTube definitely limits the reach. I
loaded two videos I didn't see any ads.
So I don't know if he's actually turned
off YouTube monetization too which is
actually bonkers. Um good for him. I
hope one day that I can be in a position
like that. But with both of them turning
off channel channel memberships, that is
one thing I am in the position to agree
with them on. You're not getting enough
value if you're paying for a membership
for me on YouTube. Um, so move it over
to the quarterin.com/join.
100% of that goes to me and you get to
talk to me directly in the Discord and
uh suggest topics for the show and take
part in our giveaways and all this kind
of stuff. If you've never used Discord
before, you don't need to download the
app. A lot of people like, I don't want
to download the app. You don't have to.
Um, but you see, you can chat directly
with me. And there are hundreds and
hundreds of members in the free Discord.
And there's a good group of people in
the members Discord, so you always have
somebody to hang out with and talk to.
Um, so
this is this is great. So interesting
stuff. I wonder if YouTube will heed
people saying, I you know, we're over
monetizing. We're stressing out our
viewers. We'll have to wait and see. But
for now, I will also turn off the
YouTube memberships and move over to uh
my own website. I can't afford to not
have the support, but I can afford to
stand in solidarity with them in saying
that this is becoming intrusive to
YouTube viewers. So hopefully you'll
switch that over today. Link in the
description, and we'll talk to you again
real soon.
