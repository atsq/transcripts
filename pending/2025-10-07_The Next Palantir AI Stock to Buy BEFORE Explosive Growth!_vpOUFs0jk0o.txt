Palanteer stock price has exploded from
$5 per share to over $190 per share,
turning early believers into
millionaires. Now, analysts are calling
in another AI defense stock as the next
Palunteer. Could this be the next
opportunity to 20x your money? Let's go
take a look. Everyone is absolutely
buzzing the next Palanteer. You've seen
the headlines. If you miss Palanteer,
buy this stock now. So, why are people
chasing the next Palanteer? Well,
simple. Palanteer exploded. This thing
went from $5.87 a share to over $190 a
share. That's almost a 20x return in a
very short period of time. And when
people see that kind of run, they start
thinking, "Man, what if I caught the
next one?" They have FOMO, fear of
missing out. We've all been there.
Palanteer's rise wasn't magic. It had
true drivers behind it. massive
government contracts, diversifying into
corporate contracts, cuttingedge AI
tools, and super strong partnerships.
They weren't just talking about AI. They
were using it to help military and
intelligence agencies make faster and
smarter decisions. And today, we're
digging into the defense stock that's
being called the next Palunteer. Is it
legit? Does the price versus value make
sense? Remember, we as value buyers want
to buy when price is below value. So,
let's break this down the everything
money way through principal- driven
investing logic, not emotions and
feelings. Let's get right into it. Let's
be honest, everyone loves the idea of
finding the next big thing. That one
stock that's going to turn a,000 bucks
into 20,000. And the media knows it.
analysts, YouTubers, even CNBC
personalities like Tom Lee and Jim
Kramer. They throw out names every
single week that this is the next Tesla,
this is the next Nvidia, this is the
next Palanteer. It's exciting, but it's
completely emotional. And the question
is, is it logical? The problem is that
this hype machine can lead people to
confuse potential with price. Just
because a stock might be great doesn't
mean the stock is a great buy.
especially if the market's already
priced in that absolutely perfect future
or even more. So, let's talk about Big
Bear AI. The ticker symbol is BB AI.
It's a smaller, lesserk known company
that analysts are watching very closely
in the AI and defense space. Now, this
is not a recommendation. I'm not here to
tell you to buy or sell in any video,
let alone this one. This is about
understanding the story and seeing what
the market is seeing, potential, the
risk, and everything in between. But
more importantly, we're here to analyze
the numbers to see if it matches the
story. Big Bear AI's core strength right
now is its position in defense and
government contracting, a lot like
Palunteer was. But despite being a
relatively small company, it landed some
serious deals. We're talking about $165
million contract with the US Army, a $13
million agreement with Department of
Defense, and a five-year deal with the
NSA. Those are major multi-year
relationships that give Big Bear a seat
at the big table. And with an overall
contract backlog of $380 million as of a
few months ago, there's a lot of locked
in business that can turn into real
revenue over the next few years,
assuming the company is able to execute.
And that part is what's important
because Big Bear success hinges on
execution. A company can sign all the
contracts in the world, but if they
can't deliver on them, it won't matter.
Just like an athlete, we all go to high
schools and we see all these great
athletes. We see the great athletes in
college and when they go pro, they
fizzle. Yes, a few blow up the hype. But
imagine if we gave every high school and
college athlete 20, 30, $40 million a
year who shows the potential of being
the next big thing. I went to Michigan
and when I went there, the number one
basketball player in the entire country
was from Ann Arbor, Lavell Blanchard.
Lavell Blanchard was number one by far.
He actually was in the same recruiting
class as Jamal Crawford who had a very,
very long NBA career. Guys, have you
heard of Lavel Blanchard? And this is
not to knock him. He was a great player
and he just didn't come out as strong
versus Jamal Crawford who went to the
NBA one year out of co one year through
college had a very long career. If we
went and gave gave Lavel Blancher this
huge contract what would have happened?
Same thing applies to stock. Now there
is upside here for Big Bear AI as a
company especially as AI defense market
itself is expected to grow to $70
billion by the mid 2030s. That's a big
wave and Big Bear is positioning itself
to ride it. But defense isn't the only
place that Big Bear is pushing. In 2024,
they acquired a company called Pangium,
a move that expanded their capabilities
into biometrics and facial recognition,
something that's very important these
days as we go on. Their system Veriscan
is already being used to streamline
airport security in places like
Nashville. That commercial use along
with new partnerships in Panama and the
UAE shows that Big Bear is trying to
diversify away from pure government
contracts and tap into high growth
markets like travel, digital identity,
and logistics. That matters because
being tied too heavily to US federal
spending comes with a lot of
unpredictability. In fact, that's a big
reason why Palanteer has done even
better because they said, "Listen, we
have too much government contracts.
we've got to diversify into more
corporate kind of contracts. That meant
smaller contract sizes, but a more
diverse revenue landscape, which is very
important for a company that's trying to
really increase their cash flow. And of
course, like most companies, leadership
is another key piece of the story. In
2025, Kevin McAllin, the former acting
secretary of Homeland Security, stepped
in as CEO. Analysts viewed this as a
strong move. He brings in deep
experience and relationships within the
federal government. And as the
co-founder of Pangium, he's personally
invested in the company's success. The
market responded very well to his
appointment, which signals some
confidence that Big Bear's new direction
may lead to stronger execution and a
clearer strategy. Guys, I know nothing
about this guy. Literally zero. But I
will say this, I like him more than Alex
Karp. I just think Alex Karp is such a
tool. Now, the stock itself is known for
wild swings, big gains, and sharp drops,
often tied more to hype than
fundamentals. And while the con company
has strong contracts, it relies heavily
on a few big clients. Guys, this sounds
eerily familiar to Palunteer's early
days. Competition is another big
challenge. Big Bear is going up against
big giants like Palunteer, Booze Allen,
and even Loheed Martin in some areas.
These are companies with a lot more
resources, deeper client relationships,
and bigger teams. Big Bear's pitch is
that smaller, more agile, and more
focused, but it's still a very steep
hill to climb. So, where does that leave
us? Analysts see a company with a
compelling story and a real opportunity,
especially in defense, AI, and
commercial biometrics. The new
leadership brings credibility. The
backlog provides revenue visibility and
the international expansion could help
stabilize the business over time. But at
the same time, the risks are real.
Execution missteps, financial
instability, and tough competition could
derail things very quickly. The real
question is whether the fundamentals
over time can justify the story. And
this is where investors need to focus.
Don't just chase that headline of the
next Palanteer. Yes, I realize that is
our headline. We're asking the question
though, is this the next Palanteer? What
has to happen for this to become the
next Palanteer? You need to understand
the business. More importantly, you need
to understand if the price is right.
That's what we're here to figure out.
So, let's look at the fundamentals of
the stock, guys. Look at this thing. It
actually all got up to $1028 earlier
this year and now it's down to seven
bucks. $2.4 billion market cap. Now, a
lot like Palanteer, the free cash flow
is a lot greater than the net income.
Here's why this happens in software.
When companies build software, they
cannot expense that software until the
software goes into use. So, they're
spending a lot of money, but then
they're finally writing it off. So,
these write-offs are probably based on
money they spent a long, long time ago.
That's why the net income showing up is
a lot lower than the free cash flow.
Now, their free 5year average free cash
flow loss is 31 million a year. Last
year, they did 37 million. their revenue
of $150 million last year. Okay, guys,
their price to sales ratio is 16. Why do
I focus on this? Well, whenever you have
companies that aren't making money, it's
nice to be able to compare them to other
companies in their industry that are
doing well. A great way to do that is
price to sales. Basically, you're market
you're dividing the market cap by the
amount of revenue in the last 12 months.
A company like Microsoft right now is 12
or 13. It probably should be 8 to 10.
Now, you might sit there and say, "Oh my
god, this is so much higher." Yes, but
this has way more growth potential than
Microsoft. Just to show you how crazy
Palanteer might be, what do you think
Palanteer's price to sales ratio is? It
is currently at $137
for a company that's worth $470 billion.
That is incredible at 190 $184 a share.
So, I want you guys to remember
something. I own stocks. For example, I
had Sprouts Farmers Market. I bought it
at 31 to 33. It went up to 165. And
people are like, "God, Paul, what a
great buy." I'm like, "Guys, it's not
worth 165." That's the difference
between me and other people on YouTube.
That other big promoter of Palunteer on
YouTube, he thinks that 184 means it's
worth 184. I want you to remember, guys,
that what we're here to teach is that
you can love something and still realize
it's overvalued. Palunteer is likely
very overvalued. Guys, at 15 times sales
with a lot of growth potential, there
could be a lot of potential here for Big
Bear AI. This does not scare me at all.
The question we have to ask ourselves is
when are they going to get to cash flow
positive? We have to look at these
things to understand that. Let's go look
at their income statement to see how
their financials have done. Now, one
kind of worry for me, look at the last
four years of revenue. They're off to a
great start. 50 million74
146 155 155 158 down to 152 in the last
12 months. I was not expecting to see
this guys. You can't pay a premium for
growth when the growth ain't there.
Doesn't mean that there's not going to
be growth in the future. But if the
growth is so obvious, how do they start
out with such a big bang and then for
five years, four years essentially be
flat? That's concerning. I give a check
mark to Palunteer here. But guys, where
is the growth here? In fact, there's a
decline in revenue here. A decline.
Okay. Again, the future could be very
bright. But this is where I go. Hang on
a second. We're hearing the stock is up
a lot. We're seeing it's up a lot. Are
the fundamentals really showing that.
Remember guys, in early startup
businesses, there can be stagnation of
revenue for a while before a big
increase. So, I don't want to dismiss
that. But, I was not expecting to see
growth growth flat. I was not expecting
to see that. especially for a company
that's supposed to be this big growth
play. Let's see if there's any analysts
following this.
Um, yeah, a few. And not much revenue
growth there either.
Guys, I don't know. This is weird to me.
Now, guys, obviously, we don't get all
analysts here, but let's look at the
eight pillars. Now, the only growth here
was revenue growth in the last 5 years,
but guess what? You can even make this
an X because it's pretty much flat. So,
guys, I want you to hear me out here. If
you're new to investing or new to
looking at a company and understand the
financials, let's let's look at it this
way. If your neighbor came to you and
said, "Hey, I want to sell you my
mechanic shop. It's growing like crazy.
It is awesome." And they say, "Great.
Show me the financials." And then their
financials were this. What would you
say? Wait, what growth?
Where's the growth happening here could
be happening in the future? Now, they
might come to you and say, "Well, yeah,
but Paul, what we don't realize is I
just got five contracts with the five
largest dealerships where they're
outsourcing all their mechanic work to
me." Okay, different situation there.
And there's a lot in the pipeline here.
That $360 million in potential contracts
that could happen. The question is over
how long a period of time, how are they
deploying things? How are they deploying
their sales team? These are things to
understand, especially early on with a
company. And all along the way, guys,
here's another concern I have. Dilution.
What does that mean? Because I'm sure
some of you who are new to watching this
don't know what that means. Let's say a
company has 10 shares outstanding and
you own one of them. You own 10% of the
business. Now, let's say they need to
raise money to go grow. So, they issue
five more shares. So, they take 10, make
it 15. How many shares do you own now?
Still one. You went from owning one of
10 shares to one of 15 shares. You went
from 10% ownership down to 6.66%
ownership. That's dilution. You did
nothing but stay committed to the
company and they made your ownership
less. Well, guys, Big Bear had 100
million shares outstanding. Now they
have 320 million shares outstanding.
Three times more. You know what's crazy?
Their revenue is up 3x. So essentially
the people who bought day one, they've
seen no gain in their ownership of that
revenue. They went from owning
having 105 million shares to split it
with to 320 million shares while their
revenue stayed went up 3x. So when the
shares increase by the same amount as
the revenue, you've seen no gain from
that. That's a huge red flag. Now guys,
even though the eight pillars here don't
look great, eight pillars is a a very
important thing to look at to tell a
story. It's not a buy decision or sell
decision. I don't know if this is a buy
or sell just based on the number of X's
or check marks, but it's important to
understand what the story is here. So,
if you want to have an easy shortcut to
understand these eight pillars, very
simple, I got a link below. Click the
link. I will email you a thorough PDF
that'll explain each pillar to you, what
it does, what it says, and why they're
important. It'll be in your email in
your inbox within one to two minutes.
Super easy. It's really important that
we're all speaking the same language.

Now, one thing I'm going to say before
we look at our stock analyzer. Most
investors are going to lose money
because they're trying so hard to pick
massive winners. They're trying to pick
the next palunteer. The best investors
do the exact opposite. They eliminate
the losers first. That's what we're
doing when we're when we're analyzing a
stock. We want to sit there and say,
"Okay, is the balance sheet okay? Is the
future okay? Is the stock price so
egregiously high that it can't even make
sense at that point and it would take
just an insane performance by the
company to even justify the price?
That's how you think like a smart
investor. You don't just follow the
stock price. Now, the issue with a
company like Big Bear is it's so young.
We don't know that future. They're
talking about big growth potential, but
yet we're not seeing it in the last few
years. How has it taken them four years
to just be flat? Where's the growth
there? These are questions to ask. So,
let's make some assumptions over the
next 10 years on Big Bear. I'm going to
warn you though, it's be very wide range
of prices. And on top of that, I just
talked about dilution. I don't know what
they're going to dilute to. If they
dilute even further, this is not going
to factor that in there. So, we're
looking at this and I'm going to be
sitting there saying, where is the
price? It's going to be hard to
determine. So, let's see what happens.
Revenue growth, guys. Again, they've had
like zero revenue growth in the last 5
years. Well, 5.47 a year. Let's do 10,
20, and 30%. Just an absurd number. 30%
growth, 20. These are very high numbers
profit margin. Let's go compare it to
Palanteer because if you look at their
gross margin, it's only 28%. This means
Palanteer's gross margin is like 80 or
90%. That means every dollar they bring
in in revenue at Palanteer, 80 or 90
cents of it goes to the bottom line. So,
what's the profit margin going to be
here? I imagine it'll get better over
time. Let's do 10, 20, and 30% as well.
Same with free cash flow.
PE,
big growth company, but in 10 years,
what it'll be? I'll go 15, 20, 25. And
guys, again, we're just guessing here.
And finally, a 9% return. As you can
tell, this is a lot harder to do for a
company like this than Microsoft or
Google, where we know that the growth is
going to be pretty consistent. There's a
reasonable range of outcomes. Guys, the
difference between 10% growth a year for
10 years and 30% is insane. How insane?
Let me show you. At 10% growth a year,
you're at 2.6 times revenue. At 30%
growth a year, you're at 13.8 times
revenue. Huge difference.
That's what's very very important to
understand. So these numbers below are
9% return to get my intrinsic value.
What's the value for it? But guys, you
got to know this thing needs margin of
safety because you have to worry about
those the dilution that's on its path.
You got to worry about all these things
going on. So, we hit the analyze button,
guys. I have a low price of a dollar,
high price of 24, middle price of six.
And keep in mind, this assumes no
dilution along the way. That's assuming
they stop diluting. It's not as bad as I
thought it was going to be. But guys,
the question is, can this company do 20%
growth a year for the next 10 years to
even justify this or 30% growth to
justify this? Is the juice worth the
squeeze? That's the question you have to
ask yourself. We all want to be able to
spot and get in on the next breakout
stock at a wonderful price. But the most
important part is understand what is a
wonderful price. Because just chasing a
story and chasing hype, it's not going
to work out very well for you. And I'm
going to level with you. super important
to get this knowledge and skill now
before the market turns. So, in this
next video, we're going to show you how
we think and value stocks like Warren
Buffett and other great value investors
so that you're prepared to act and be
calm when others are panicking and
selling. The video is linked right on
your screen, so don't miss it. This is
how you get ready for your moment. Thank
