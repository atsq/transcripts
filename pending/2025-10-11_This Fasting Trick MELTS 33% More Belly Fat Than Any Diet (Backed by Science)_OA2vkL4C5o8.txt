you're probably fasting the wrong way
and you're missing out on 33% more fat
burn because of it. This one tweak can
skyrocket results. And it's backed up by
hard science, not hype. I'll break it
all down and I'll show you exactly how
to do it step by step. If you've
plateaued or you just want to burn fat
faster, this will change your entire
approach. You see, most people fast to
burn fat. But here's what they get
wrong. They stop eating and they also
stop moving. They treat fasting as an
excuse to conserve energy, sit on the
couch and just wait for the fat to melt
off. But the truth is your body only
starts tapping into fat stores when
insulin drops and your muscles send
signals to do so. So when you combine
fasting with movement, especially the
right type of fasted exercise, which
I'll break down for you, something
incredible happens. You turn on a switch
called AM PK. I want you to think of the
switch as your cellular fat burning
switch. Without that, fasting is like
owning a Ferrari, but never turning the
key and starting the ignition. And this
one study has shocked scientists all
across the world. In this landmark study
published in the Journal of Clinical
Endrochronology and Metabolism,
researchers compared two groups. Group
one exercised after breakfast. After
they broke their fast. Group two
exercised before they broke their fast.
In other words, before breakfast, while
they were in a fasted state. The
results, the fasted group burned 33%
more fat. And not just during the
exercise, but for hours after. Their
insulin sensitivity skyrocketed. their
muscle mitochondria, which are these
little engines in your cells that run
your metabolism. They grew in both size
and number and their metabolism
continued to burn fat even after rest,
even after they broke the fast. Question
is why? And this is why. When you
exercise in the fasted state, your body
has burned through its sugar reserves
and you're not putting glucose energy
back in from food cuz you're fasted. So,
it's forced to tap into stored fat for
energy. The visual I want to give you
here is is this bus. Let's call it a a
metabolic bus. If you had breakfast
before exercise, you're going to put
your breakfast calories, the food you
just ate, at the front of this metabolic
bus to be used for energy first. And
then once you burn through, eventually
you'll start tapping into stored fat,
belly fat for energy. But when you go
into a workout, an exercise without the
meal on an empty stomach, your sugar
reserves, which are called your glycogen
stores, are already low. You're going to
burn through that. And now what's at the
front of this metabolic bus? It's your
belly fat. It's your visceral fat. It's
the stored energy on your body. So you
tap into that stored energy, the belly
fat, much faster when you exercise the
right way in a fasted state. So here's
what's happening under the hood when you
accomplish this. Number one, you're
going to get an insulin drop. Now, that
already happens during a fast, but it
happens even more readily and rapidly
when you exercise in a fasted state. Of
course, as you drop insulin, you unlock
more stored fat to be used for energy.
The second really cool thing that
happens here is that catakolamines begin
to rise. Exercise in the fasted state
increases adrenaline and noradrenaline.
These are hormones that mobilize fat.
The third step here is that you activate
EMPK, that cellular switch. This enzyme
senses energy depletion and it signals
to your body to burn fat instead of
sugar. The fourth thing that happens
here is mitochondria multiply. This is
called mitochondrial fitness or
mitochondrial biogenesis. Essentially,
it's the creation of new mitochondria.
You see, fasted workouts boost
mitochondrial biogenesis. These energy
factories begin to multiply. What does
that mean? That means your cells are
producing more energy, which actually
helps you burn more fat. And the fifth
thing is that you enhance a process
called autophagy. You not only burn fat
here, but you're cleaning out damaged
cells, proteins, and mitochondria,
improving metabolic health long term.
It's like activating Pac-Man to seek out
damaged cells and mitochondria and eat
them for energy and allow them to burn
fat and produce more energy more
efficiently. This combination is like a
metabolic symphony. Fasting sets the
stage and the right movement conducts
the orchestra. So, when's the perfect
time? And what are the best exercises to
do while fasting? It's going to be early
morning, right after you wake up before
your first meal. You see, at this point,
you've slept overnight. Let's say your
dinner was at 7:00 p.m. You have those
few hours of fasting before bed. You go
to bed, and every hour you're depleting
those sugar reserves. You're dropping
and lowering insulin. So, insulin is
already low. Sugar reserves are already
low. You're now primed to torch fat.
Now, the exercise duration, there's kind
of like a Goldilock zone here. You don't
want to do too much, too high intensity,
and you don't want to do too little. So,
I would start out if you're new to this
protocol here with by simply going for a
30 to if you can, 60minute walk in the
morning on an empty stomach. This is
also going to be the better option for
women who don't necessarily want to do a
highintensity workout on an empty
stomach first thing in the morning. Now,
for you guys, you could actually do
high-intensity exercise. You could do
some sprints. You could do some hit
training. You could do some strength
training. 20 to 30 minutes if you're
doing a strength training workout, that
will suffice. Now, the type of exercises
that I would recommend are going to be
walking or zone 2 cardio. That's for
beginners and for women, especially
cycling women. And then for men and more
advanced individuals, resistance
training, sprinting, or hit workouts.
Now, you might be wondering, what can I
take before my fasted workout? Is there
anything that will break a fast? Is
there anything that will enhance my
results here? The answer is yes and yes.
Okay, here's what I would recommend you
have before that morning cardio or
workout. A cup of high quality black
coffee or if you don't like coffee,
organic green tea. You see, both enhance
fat oxidation and there's an adrenaline
release. You see, coffee, for example,
when it's sourced the right way, it's
medium roasted, it's organic, it's
tested for contaminants. This has a high
concentration of a fat blasting
polyphenol called chlorogenic acid CGA.
And then high quality organic green tea
has EGCG and kakans which actually have
been shown to target belly fat. So
either option works. Either options are
beneficial. I'll drop a link for my
favorite coffee down below and I'll drop
a link for my favorite green tea down
below. Now I would also recommend you
have water with electrolytes. This is
probably better before the coffee or the
tea. 12 ounces of high quality water
with a pinch of high quality unrefined
sea salt or an unflavored electrolyte is
a great idea. And if you wanted to add
an additional fat burning booster and
something that could actually help with
your blood sugar and energy levels and
it does not break a fast, add in with
that cup of water I mentioned in the sea
salt. Add in a tablespoon of apple cider
vinegar. Apple cider vinegar has amazing
benefits for blood sugar regulation,
energy, doesn't break a fast, it
supports the fast. It has short- chain
fatty acids. It's It's incredible. What
you want to do is avoid anything with
sugar, carbs, and protein. So, you don't
want a banana. You don't want a smoothie
until after your session is done, if you
choose to have that. So, here's what's
going to happen after you follow this
routine. Post-workout, your metabolism
stays primed for fat burning for hours
after that fasted session. Scientists
call it the afterburn effect or epoch,
excess post exercise oxygen consumption.
This means your body is burning fat even
while you're sitting at your desk. Now,
which meal is best to break your fast
with after this post-workout? You want
to prioritize protein and healthy fats?
Think eggs, grass-fed beef, bacon, wild
salmon, even avocado, green leafy
vegetables. These are going to be a
great way to break your fast. You want
to avoid breaking the fast with high
carbohydrates. Avoid orange juice,
oatmeal, cereal, bread. that will
mitigate some of the results we're
looking to seek here. And wait at least
30 to 60 minutes after your workout to
keep those fat burning enzymes
activated. Now, there's some nuance
here. Let me share with you what I
believe are the mistakes people make
with this protocol. Number one, they're
overtraining in that fasted state. Now,
this could spike cortisol too high. So,
you don't want to do sprints every
morning in the fasted state. You don't
want to do highintensity interval
training, hit training, or strength
training every single day. You want to
mix it up with some highintensity
workouts and some cardio, zone 2 cardio,
which is just walking. So, I think a
good protocol would be two or three days
out of the week if you wanted to do the
HIT training or the strength training,
do that in the fasted state. The other
days, simply go for a 30-minute walk.
Another mistake people make is breaking
that fast with carbs and sugar and even
seed oils. You will lose some of the
benefits you've have achieved during
that fasted workout. Another mistake is
sleeping too little and not prioritizing
recovery. Sleep deprivation makes it
more difficult to fast. It increases
hunger. It disrupts insulin and hormone
signaling. So, make sure you're getting
quality sleep. Remember, the goal isn't
punishment. It's precision. So, let me
give you a 3-day fasted exercise reset
protocol. Here's a simple plan to start
what you just learned. Days 1, 2, and
three, follow this protocol. You're
going to fast overnight for 14 to 16
hours. So, if you're done eating at 8:00
p.m., you should wait until at least
10:00 a.m. to break the fast. And right
before that, you're going to do your 30
minute walk or light resistance training
before breakfast. Third step is you're
going to break your fast with mostly
protein and fat, minimal carbohydrates,
and step number four, stay hydrated
throughout the day, and always get your
gratitude, which lowers cortisol,
stress, and inflammation. By day three
of doing this simple protocol, you'll
notice better focus, more stable energy,
and of course, a smaller waistline. Now,
I'm going to get to the top questions
you submitted on this topic right here.
Before I do, I want to give you another
protocol to add to this protocol after
you've mastered this to help you
continue to get results. This is called
my keto egg fast protocol, and I built
it all out on a free PDF. If you've
tried everything to try to lose those
last 10 lbs and nothing has worked, stop
what you're doing. This simple eggbased
protocol has helped thousands of my
clients torch fat, cut cravings, and
drop up to 10 pounds in just 7 days. No
starvation, no tracking, no BS. It works
by hacking your metabolism using eggs,
healthy fats, and strategic intermittent
fasting to put your body in a deep fat
burning state. This is metabolic
warfare, and it's free. Click the first

away from seeing real change in the
mirror. Go get your free guide. Now,
let's get to your questions. What if I
feel dizzy or lightaded during a fasted
workout? Should I stop or should I
modify it? I would modify it. I wouldn't
do a highintensity workout if you're
feeling dizzy. I would just go for a
walk. And if you're still experiencing
dizziness or lightadedness, it's because
you're not hydrating enough. You want to
increase those electrolytes, increase
your minerals, and have that before you
go for that walk. That should fix any
issues here. Is it okay to drink
preworkout or branch chain amino acids
before fasted exercise or does that
break a fast? Well, it kind of depends.
If you're doing a highintensity strength
training workout, I would definitely
recommend essential amino acids. Not
necessarily a pre-workout cuz some of
them contain ingredients that are
artificial and excess caffeine. And in
general, I'm just not a big fan of
pre-workouts. Coffee is fine, but
pre-workouts not fine. But a high
quality essential amino acid, totally
fine if you're doing strength training
or highintensity training. Can I still
get muscle gains while working out in a
fasted state or will I lose lean mass?
Ooh, the body's very smart. You will not
lose lean mass. You could actually build
muscle mass. As long as you're getting
enough protein during your eating
window. Consider this. When you're in a
fasted state, your metabolism is smart.
Your body's smart. It raises human
growth hormone to preserve lean muscle
mass. So, you could follow this protocol
and actually build lean muscle mass,
which is a a great idea for both men and
women. Can I combine cold exposure or
sauna with fasted exercise for even
better results? Yes, you can. But I
wouldn't do it all at once. I would
first master the fasted exercise. Do
that for a week. Then add in either cold
exposure, like a cold plunge, a cold
shower, or sauna, not both at the same
time. And build your tolerance up to
both. Either sauna or cold plunge. Don't
throw it all in at once. It could be too
much stress for your body to handle. And
this is always different for women
versus men. Men could get away with
adding more cold plunge and sauna. Women
need to be a little bit more delicate,
especially if you have a menstrual
cycle. So, you always want to pay
attention to how you feel the rest of
the day and track things like your
sleep, resting, heart rate, and HRV to
see if you're doing too much stress to
your body or if you're adapting well to
the stress. How can I tell if my
cortisol is too high from fasting or
fasted workouts? And what signs should I
look for? Yeah, pay attention to how you
feel the rest of the day. I kind of just
said that, but you should feel more
energized. You should have a good mood
throughout the rest of the day. You
should get good sleep. If you feel more
depleted the rest of the day, if your
sleep is not great that night, you're
probably doing too much. You might want
to cut the time frame of your fasted
workout. Instead of doing highintensity,
go for a light 15 to 30 minute walk and
build your way up to that stress
tolerance. That's the protocol. Follow
it and get those amazing results. And I
just published another video that is
really important to watch after this
lesson. and it's about seven strange
signs your fasting is working. Even if
you feel like it's not, you're going to
want to watch this video. Here's a clip
from that lesson. Click the video on the
screen and I'll see you in that next
video. Number one, the scale goes up.
Most people fast expecting the scale to
plummet. So, when it jumps 2 to 5 lbs,
they panic. But here's the kicker.
Weight gain can actually be a sign your
fast is working. See, your body stores
what's called glycogen. This is stored
sugar in your liver and in your muscle
cells.
