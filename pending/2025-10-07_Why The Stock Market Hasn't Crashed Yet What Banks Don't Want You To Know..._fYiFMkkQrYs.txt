Why hasn't the stock market crashed yet?
Have you ever stopped and really asked
yourself that question? Because when you
look at the numbers, when you look at
the history, when you look at the way
things usually work, the market today
should have already collapsed into
pieces. Yet, it hasn't. In fact, it
keeps climbing higher, breaking records
and leaving everyone scratching their
heads. And the truth is, there are
reasons for this. reasons that most
people don't know about and reasons that
the banks and institutions would rather
you didn't understand. Because once you
do, you will see the game clearly. You
will see why the system is still holding
together and why it feels like something
bigger is being hidden in plain sight.
And stay until the end to see when it
will crash. Leave a like and let's start
now. Let's start with something very
simple. Numbers don't lie. If you take
Warren Buffett's favorite measure for
valuing the market, which is the total
value of all the companies compared to
the size of the economy, the result
today is completely insane. The total
market cap is around $66 trillion. The
GDP of the United States is around $30
trillion. Divide 66 by 30 and you get
over 216%.
Now, here's the key. Anything above 100%
means the market is overvalued. Back in
1999, before the dotcom bubble burst,
the number was 115%.
And after that, the market collapsed by
more than 60%. But today, it isn't 115%.
It isn't 150%. It's over 216%.
If you only looked at that, you would
think the market should already be in
ruins. And yet, here we are. Even if you
look at the top companies in the S&P
500, the biggest, the ones that drive
most of the market's growth, you will
see something even more shocking. Their
average price toearnings ratio is around
66. To put that in perspective, normal,
healthy companies usually trade at 15 or
20. Tech companies sometimes trade
higher, maybe 25, maybe 30. But 66 is
absurd. That means investors are paying
$66 for every $1 of earnings. It's like
paying $66 for a burger that should cost
just one. It makes no sense. And yet
people keep buying. So the obvious
question is this. If valuations are off
the charts, if history tells us crashes
happen when numbers get this high, if
even Warren Buffett himself is sitting
on cash instead of buying stocks, then
why is the crash not arrived? Why does
the market keep climbing? The answer is
not simple, but once you understand it,
everything falls into place. Here's
where the mystery begins. Think about
cycles. The market moves in waves. At
first, investors are excited. Money
flows in. Prices rise. Then, smart money
realizes prices are too high. They sell.
Panic spreads and a crash follows. Then,
new investors step in at the bottom.
They buy and the cycle repeats. This has
happened again and again throughout
history. But now the pattern seems
broken. The market is at a peak, but the
big players aren't dumping everything.
They're still in the game. And that
tells us something powerful is happening
underneath. One of the biggest reasons
is government spending. The US
government is not just a participant in
the economy. It is the single biggest
spender. Every year it collects around
$5 trillion in taxes and then it spends
that money on social security, on
Medicare, on the military, on paying
interest on debt. That money doesn't
disappear. It ends up in people's hands.
And what do people do when they have
money? They spend it. They buy iPhones.
They eat at restaurants. They fill their
cars with gas. And where does all that
money go? straight back into the pockets
of the biggest corporations, the same
corporations that dominate the stock
market. But it doesn't stop there
because the government isn't just
spending the 5 trillion it collects. It
is also overspending by at least 2
trillion more. Borrowing from the future
to keep today's machine running. That
borrowed money again flows through the
system into people's hands into
corporations earnings and back into the
market. So the real question isn't why
the market hasn't crashed, but why the
government is overspending by such a
massive amount. To answer that, you have
to understand the bigger picture. Since
1945, the US created and controlled the
world order. It was the industrial
leader, the technological leader, the
financial leader. If you wanted
protection, you played by US rules. If
you wanted access to the global
financial system, you played by US
rules. If you wanted the best products,
you played by US rules. For decades,
there was no serious challenger. But
today, that is changing. Countries like
China, India, and others are rising.
They are building their own systems,
their own militaries, their own
technologies. They are saying they don't
want to depend on the US system anymore.
And that shift threatens America's
position at the top. So, the US has made
a strategic choice. Spend. spend as much
as necessary, even if it means borrowing
from the future. Even if it means
running massive deficits because the
priority is to protect its dominance in
this new world order that is forming.
The government believes that by
overspending now by pushing trillions
into the system, it can stay on top
until the dust settles. Now, here's the
part banks don't want you to fully
understand. When the government does
this, when it floods the system with
borrowed money, it creates devaluation.
Think of it this way. If there were only
$10 in an economy, those dollars would
be very valuable. If suddenly there are
$20, each one is worth less. That's
inflation. That's devaluation.
And that's exactly what is happening
with the US dollar. And this is why the
stock market hasn't crashed because
investors aren't just betting on
companies productivity. They are betting
on the dollar losing value. They know
that as the dollar weakens, companies
will raise prices. Earnings will rise,
not necessarily because companies are
producing more, but because prices are
higher. And that in turn makes today's
insane valuations look justified in the
future. Think about it. If a company
sells a product for $100 today and earns
$10 profit, its earnings are 10. But if
inflation pushes that product's price to
$200, suddenly earnings double to 20,
even if nothing else changed. That's the
hidden engine keeping the stock market
alive. It's not pure growth. It's not
pure innovation. It's a quiet ongoing
bet on inflation and devaluation.
But this creates another huge problem.
wealth inequality because who owns the
majority of the stock market? The top
10%, the bottom 90% of Americans own
almost nothing in comparison. So, as the
dollar loses value, as stocks climb
higher, the rich get richer. They don't
feel the pain. But the bottom 90%, the
people without significant investments,
they fall behind. Their wages don't rise
at the same pace. their groceries, their
rent, their gas, all become more
expensive. And the wealth gap stretches
wider and wider. This is what banks and
institutions don't want you to see
clearly. They don't want you to notice
that the market's rise is built on a
foundation of devalued dollars and
inequality.
They want you to keep believing that
everything is normal, that growth is
real, that nothing is wrong. But the
truth is, the system is being
artificially held together. And sooner
or later, reality will break through.
Some of the smartest investors know
this. Warren Buffett, for example, is
sitting on massive amounts of cash. He
knows this game can't last forever. He
knows that when the correction comes, it
will be brutal, and he is preparing to
use that moment to buy assets at a
discount, just like he has done before.
He is patient because he knows cycles
always come back around. So, where does
that leave you? You can't afford to sit
on the sidelines and hope for the best.
If you do nothing, your money will
simply lose value as the dollar
continues to devalue.
If you act wisely, if you invest in the
right assets, you can protect yourself
and even grow your wealth in this
strange environment.
But there is no middle ground. Doing
nothing is the same as choosing to lose.
This is the hidden truth about why the
stock market hasn't crashed yet. It is
being propped up by government
overspending, by borrowed money, by the
deliberate devaluation of the dollar,
and by the actions of the wealthiest
investors who are playing a long game
most people don't even see. It's a
system that works for now, but it's
unsustainable.
The question is not if the crash will
come, but when. And when it does, the
ones who prepared will be ready. The
ones who didn't will pay the price.
That's why it's critical to see the
system for what it is. To stop believing
the illusion that everything is normal
and to make decisions now that protect
your future because the banks and
institutions may not want you to know
this, but you do now and the choice is
in your hands. Let me know your thoughts
