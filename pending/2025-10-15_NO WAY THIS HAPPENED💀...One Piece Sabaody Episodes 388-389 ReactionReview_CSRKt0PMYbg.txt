who's behind that mask?
Probably behind the mask.
And Jack's like, "You should know. You
should know." But like, I feel like I
should know.
Maybe you do know.
I mean, the way it's been built up is
just out of control. So, why are you not
pressing play yet? If you're watching

I would really appreciate it, and so
would Jack and Canon and McKay
if you came and uh joined us on our
Twitch live stream for uh League of
Legends. I know you're going to see this
on Thursday,
but still. Yeah, it would be awesome if
you went and gave it a follow or a sub.
We have a lot of people that gift subs
over there, so we'll probably get gifted
one.
That's true.
And if you came over there and if you
hung out with us while we streamed on
the Twitch, if you're still watching

Dude, if I was the fish, I'd be like,
"Nah, I'm calling it quits. You're going

her echolocation on the fish to like
stop them from flying."
But
I didn't think there were so many.

That is actually so funny, though.

Love when Sanji's on fire.
[Music]
You would have thought this guy,
dude. The animation looks so good.
You keep saying that as if the animation
down the line isn't good.

Why do they even do that? What do they
do?
[Music]
Like, what the

We haven't had like a Sanji focused arc
in a while.
Whoa.

maneuverability of the Sunny is top
tier. So many secrets

Oh my god. No, he's fine.
Just let him die there.
He's living my dream.
Such a crash out.
[Music]
This guy's eyes literally could care
less
with that face. Holy cow.
He looks like one of those island
totems.
[Music]
Oh,
are they emoting like way more than they
normally do? Like
What the heck did he just What did Luffy
just do?
He just got shook. He's like, I ain't
messing with that.
Luffy got some secret superpower.
He's
just too menacing.
Was it like his uh was it his hockey or
something? Was it his hockey, dude? Did
he randomly have some hockey? Hall of
Fame intimidator badge activated.
Something's going on over there. You
don't think Luke is just intimidating
like that?
No.
Stopped him in charge and he's like
full.
Finish finish the fight.
I love his little thing.
[Music]
Get rid of him. Get rid of him.
I like this. I like just
change his face.
What if he doesn't look the same? So
like it changes the
handsome Squidward.
It's hiding his face. Hiding his face in
case.
Enjoy the
Wow, man. What a crazy two.
Don't worry. This arc's not going to be
that long.
But some of us funny.
It's good.
Yeah, that was nuts.
I like slipped another rib, dude.
From laughing too hard.
What's going on over there with the
bowl?
Laughing too hard.
What's going on with the bowl? Everyone
messed with the bowl, you get the whole
as I've never seen that. Everyone's Why
did Why did every character like pull
attention to it?
Yeah. Robin's like, "Wait, what?
intimidated.
Seems just intimidated
looking at it.
He stopped the bull.
What the heck was that?
Although there was like there wasn't
like any
moto.
There wasn't any like power surge or
like any
Yeah. Dude just looked him in the eyes
was like
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. When
freaking Shanks walked onto Whitebeard's
boat, all of the guys started passing
out and the bowl passed out. It's like
you walk in here throwing your hockey
around. That's what Whitebeard said.
Don't know. Don't know.
Oh, you don't know.
It's hockey time.
Oh, I'm so
even know what hockey is.
Convincing this time. You You've done
well.
You don't even know what hockey is, you
bum.
Jack, I'm reading
second rate bum.
That was That was crazy for
That was pretty funny.
No, that was good. That was good. I
cannot believe that the reveal was the
guy just looks exactly like that. That's
the craziest thing ever. I can't believe
they used that all of that guy just to
show off Luffy using hockey on a full
that whole thing.
I can't believe that.
I can't believe that Frankie made the
Death Star laser inside of the the
thousand.
He doesn't even be no Kyber crystal.
Dude, I always almost say the going
sunny,
bro. Buster call for what, man? Just get
yourself a freaking
Get yourself an air cannon.
Get yourself a thousand,
dude. Maybe maybe he copied it from
Pluton.
It's just less powerful.
Oh, yeah. I forgot. Like
McKay was talking to me the other day
about
I was like, what? Remember when um
remember how the freaking plans were
such a big deal for Frankie and then it
just mean like like that was the biggest
deal for CP9? I was just
Well, they burned it. I don't.
No. No. He But M's like he knows the
plans. Like they're in his head.
Like he knows the plans at least to some
degree.
No, no. But he needed him and who else?
It was him and someone else. It was like
Frankie doesn't know like the whole
plans, right? Like
I think he needed
Robin and so I'm saying like
but he's also going to kill her.
They haven't like they never like we
never really they never
got no death, dude.
No, they're still both alive. the two
people that are needed.
It's like this valuable piece of
that actually is true.
They required like a whole bust recall
and then it just kind of fizzled out,
you know.
Yeah.
I mean the people who
Frankie still alive. He knew the plans.
Robin's still alive. She's able to read
Pontoglyph. So,
you never know.
Jack just randomly brings that up about
the thousand sunny.
Okay, buddy.
What about it? No, I just was I just
thought, "Wow." Because of what me me
and McKay talked about.
Oh, I know. Oh, I know.
Because May was like, "Couldn't he like
build stuff?" Or like we were talking
about like, "Yeah, maybe you can like he
could build stuff or he could build the
pluton or something."
He just like mass build freaking
Minecraft creative mode.
Dude, his fle
especially after
what he just did with that um
that rocket launcher in the front. He
could probably build this uh whatever
pluton is.
Dude, he he could build an air pressure.
I can't believe Brooke just broke one of
his cola cannons, dude. Out of nowhere.
That was so depressing.
I don't think that was canon.
This is like the most
So, I don't think that was canon. But
this is the most interesting like
random start to this arc. Like I'm sure
it'll tie in. I just don't see like how
other than with Hachin and like Ky. But
it's like
it already t
Did Oda want to just meme for a minute,
you know? Like
I mean if he did it was funny. No, it's
just funny. Yeah, cuz it's just so like
you
wronged me.
You really can never guess, man. You can
never guess what's going to happen. Like
if you you could have given me weeks to
guess like who that guy was, I would
have never thought it's Sanji's poster
come to life.
Yep. Why does it look like Luffy's
wearing a
predictable?
Yeah, know that was that was that was
just so crazy.
I don't know where we go from here
really, but uh I guess that's for us to
find out. Well, guys, what will we find
next time? And we'll see.
