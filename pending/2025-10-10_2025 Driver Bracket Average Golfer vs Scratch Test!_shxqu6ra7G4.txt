I have nine of the hottest drivers in
golf, but only one can be crowned best
driver of 2025. Now, I know most of you
don't really care about the results of a
scratch golfer with high club head
speeds. So, I invited my buddy who's a
weekend warrior.
This is Brent. Both of us are going to
be hitting the drive, comparing data,
and only four are moving on to our
semi-final bracket. Ready to do this?
>> Let's do this. You guys are watching
Golf and this is the 2025 driver
bracket.
For this testing, we are going to hit
nine drivers. We're going to break them
into groups of three. Okay. So, the
first grouping is going to be the Tailor
Made, the Ping, and the Wilson. We're
going to start with the Tailormaid. This
is a Qi35. We are using the core models
for all of the drivers. This is the the
testing that I would be comfortable
sending any average golfer to the golf
store. They pick up a core model. I
think it is good for low handicap
golfers, high handicapped golfers. I
think that this is like the best
starting point. What we're going to do,
we're both going to hit six drives.
We're then going to just compare the
data. And out of the three, only one is
moving on. Okay. So, we got three groups
of three. There's going to be one wild
card. We are both using the exact same
shafts. You are using a Diamana blue
board. I will be using an autoflex
shaft. And I'm really excited to show
you my new launch monitor. We are using
the Unicor EXO2. We got the elevation
set at 3,400 ft since we are in Calgary.
So, we can be at least familiar with the
numbers that we hit when we play
outside. I'm excited to see you hit. So,
thank you for coming on the channel,
Brent. Welcome back. Let's start hitting
some.
>> Sounds good.
>> How far do you say you hit your driver
right now?
>> Uh, I'd like to say total is about 260,
270 on my good ones total.
>> Okay.
>> Carry really varies. I'd like to say I
hit it 240, 250 carry when I'm hitting
it well, but yeah.
>> Sweet.
>> That was hit hard. What's your normal
shot shape? a cut a little to the right.
Not a ton, but And then when I'm
missing, my miss is usually uh
absolutely off the toe. And you know
what happens when you hit it off the
toe? It's a little hook hooky. So
snappy.
>> A little snappy.
>> That was a good one.
>> Yeah, just the spin is my uh is an issue
for me.
>> That is crazy low spin. I would like to
see at least double that. Have you been
on a sim before? like do
>> I have um I have and yeah like typically
if I'm hitting it good I'm like 19 like
1 1600 to 1900 which is still too low
>> and I don't hit it very hard obviously
so if I don't hit it
>> launch it high enough and it just drops
out of there.
>> Gotcha.
>> Yeah.
>> What's a handicap sitting at right now?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you,
but it's I mean it I've been as low as a
five this year. I'm back up to a 10, 11,
back down to a seven. So, currently I'm
probably around there. I hit a lot of
fairways. Not super far, but I hit a lot
of fairways.
>> What are your thoughts so far? Kind of
sound and feel of this club.
>> I like this club. This is actually my
gamer, the Qi35.
>> You're gaming this club?
>> I am. Oh, I should see what you were
hitting before we started.
>> Yeah. No, I I I really like it a lot.
It's super super forgiving. Like even on
those like big toe misses, like on
previous drivers I've had, it's just a
snap hook and sometimes I like get away
with it. So,
>> I didn't realize you had a new driver.
>> Yes.
>> Cuz I thought you were hitting like a
Sim 2 or one of the older ones.
>> Big Tailor- made guy. I've had the Sim,
the Stealths, the Qi10, and I play a lot
of golf, and Tailor Made has been really
good about sending me new ones when they
sometimes break. So, it was a warranty
replacement.
>> Didn't get fit. You didn't go through
the fitting process.
>> No fit. It was just
>> I I had like a $600 driver and they sent
me a nice brand new one. So,
>> Okay. Well, this is actually It's going
to be a fun test because maybe we might
find one driver that's better than that.
>> I would love that.
>> Are there any drivers that you kind of
had your eye on that you were thinking
about getting when your driver broke or?
>> I mean, I actually wanted to go and get
fitted, but then they sent me this and I
just I just didn't. But a lot of my
buddies have the new Titus GT3
>> and they they love it. So,
>> well, it'll be interesting to see.
>> Yeah.
>> Same thing, but oh well.
>> Like crazy low spin, man. Like, from
like a fitting standpoint, like I'm I'm
kind of bummed that I only have 90
degree heads cuz loft would help you add
spin, right? Like an 11 degree or 12
degree even, it would definitely help
you with your loft. We're going to just
put everything on the higher setting. I
think the majority of average golfers,
if they're hitting it low, they're going
to just put it on the high setting. So,
I think that's just like a realistic
>> test for you. Let's just look at that
session really quick. Let's pull up your
grouping. Okay, Brent, here's your
session from like a grouping standpoint.
So, in actually a pretty good sample
size, like you're incredibly consistent
distancewise. You're averaging like 237
carry, 259 total. Would those be close
to what you're seeing on the golf
course? You think you said kind of like
260, 270 on your best ones, right? I'm
putting you on the spot, putting you in
front of a camera. Hey,
>> hey, Dance Monkey, perform.
>> The spin just super low. Like, I love
I'm I'm interested to see what other
heads do spin-wise, especially at this
setting. So, let me throw in the driver
head into my shaft and we can compare
side by side.
>> Okay, sounds good.
>> I'll let you guys know that the ball
we're using is a Tailor Made TP5. I
normally play the TP5X, but you I know
have low spin, so I didn't want to stack
the deck against you. Thank you.
>> So, but I I I don't I never noticed like
a huge difference off the TE. Maybe a
couple hundred RPMs. For a shaft, I'm
going to use the Autoflex Auto Power
Snipe. This is a 60 g shaft that we've
used in other driver testings and so far
a fan of the auto flex
just a little farther than mine.
Little pulley. I mean like for me out of
the gate like to be 2400 is like super
ideal. It didn't feel that pulley. Like
I'm looking at the impact and I wasn't
that far on the toe and unfortunately we
just missed the club face angle. So
let's see uh see what else we got here.
That felt about right. Felt a little
heel cuddy.
>> What driver are you playing right now?
>> Funny story. I was also playing a Tailor
Made and it also broke. Hopefully that's
not a trend. We're going with Tailor
Made. But I had a Mini driver from this
year kind of just sitting in my bag, the
R seven mini driver. And just cuz I
wasn't sure what I wanted to do. Like
I've never hit this mini driver. Maybe I
would like that. And I've I've lost some
yards cuz it's obviously not as big, but
like I'm finding a ton of fairways. So
for me, like at that club has been that
distance. If I pull one bat or I really
push one, it's like toast. So to
sacrifice a little bit of distance and
keep it in play, I've actually been
hitting it pretty good.
>> You have plenty of distance. I think you
can sacrifice a couple yards.
I think I gained some speed with my new
uh dad's strength.
>> I mean, first of all, I'm happy to be
back doing a driver bracket. We didn't
get to do one last year. with just the
worst injury, a hip injury. And for
golf, that just sucks. I think the last
time we were testing drivers, I was like
118,
>> 119.
>> Yeah, you're killing it.
>> So, it' be like 120. That just doesn't
feel normal for me. But, I mean, I'm
someone play the world's smallest violin
for me right now.
>> Yeah. Poor you.
I mean, I like how the Qi35 feels off
the face. I've done extensive review on
this. I did get better numbers out of
this than the Qi 10, just barely. So, I
know it's a good baseline. Let's uh
compare this data here. Okay, Brent. So,
I think what I find right off the bat is
the two of us distance-wise were very
consistent, right? We didn't have a ton
of like really short ones, really long
ones. I think especially on mine, they
almost went like the exact same
difference every time. But it seems like
I have the same amount go kind of right
that I had left, but I think they would
all be in play. You obviously you said
you found fairways a ton and obviously
with this collection is more impressive
dispersion wise than mine.
>> Yeah.
>> I just wanted to take a look at my
numbers just so I know the baseline.
>> So it looks like I was averaging like
311 carry 330 total.
>> That's it.
>> What was your 237 and 259? So you know
obviously two different golfers.
>> But I think when I'm looking at that
grouping I'm happy with that benchmark.
Okay. Next club we're going to take a
look at is the Ping. Okay. My boy Ping
G440 Max.
>> Okay. I've never hit a Ping club in my
life.
>> You've hit Ping? Well, you tested irons
with me. You definitely
>> It's a lie. You're right. I Yeah, I sure
have.
>> Okay. You know the drill. Six hits. If
anything stands out, you let me know.
>> Sure.
>> Okay. I thought that might happen. So,
let me let me tell you a little
something about fitting heads. The
fitting head that I had from Tailor Made
has these new indicators on the face.
Okay, more for other types of fitting
software. It wasn't picking up the
strike location because of those
indicators. Okay,
>> but I put indicator tape on all the
other ones. I had tape on the Tailor
Made and it seems like the indicators on
the face overrode it.
>> So, if you look on the screen, see where
that strike is dead center on the club
head face. So, that's where you hit it.
Look at that spin. 2500 out of the gate.
>> Yeah. No, it was good. It was good.
Oh, it's a little block.
>> I mean, spin is up considerably.
>> Spin is up and actually I feel like I'm
hitting it more consistently on the
face. I'm not really missing on the toe
or the heel.
>> I mean, back to back, you were dead
center of the club face.
>> Yeah,
>> that one was off the toe.
>> Just didn't come back. So, what we were
seeing with the tailor made is that you
were getting the gear effect.
>> Okay,
>> it was coming back. remember we had a
couple that went to the left.
>> Yeah. So, from my experience, when I hit
it like off the toe with the tailor
made, I almost never miss.
>> Really? Okay.
>> Right. Almost never.
>> I mean, I like the idea with any driver
to take away one side of the course.
>> Yeah. That would be amazing,
>> right?
>> Yeah.
>> Hey, true or false, you can dunk a
basketball.
>> Not now. Maybe what am I 34 now? So,
maybe like 15 16 years ago, I could dunk
a basketball.
>> And how tall are you?
>> 57 and 3/4. I'd say like probably 5'6
under. I'm 6'2 and I can barely touch
the rim.
>> I mean, that was 30 lb ago and 16 years
ago, but we'll take it.
>> What are the thoughts? I can see the
wheels turning.
>> I mean, I like it. I actually really
like this. I'm find I'm hitting the
center of the face more. It's just
leaking to the right, which is like I
usually hit a cut, but it's just kind of
more of a block.
>> Yeah. Like if we were doing like more of
a fitting, I would play around with all
the head settings, but we have to just
keep everything consistent. I love the
spin. Like for me, that's the first
thing that I'm looking at. Just his head
on the same setting as the tailor made
is giving you way more spin.
>> It is.
>> I would say like your impact, your
strike position where the ball is
hitting the screen has all been the
same, I think, as Taylor made.
>> Okay.
>> But they're just not turning over.
>> Yeah. I mean, I feel I feel like I mean,
that one was a little off the toe, but I
feel I feel like I've hit closer to the
center of the face on every one of these
on the pain.
>> So, again, just a little right side. I I
guess you did actually have some Okay,
you only had that one turnover in that
session. I thought for some reason you
were turning it over more,
>> but very similar, I think. Like the fact
that these are overlapping,
>> probably similar price point. I think
ping is actually just slightly more
expensive than the tailor made.
>> Let me take a look at your session data.
The thing I wanted to look at was the
spin
>> 700 difference. Yeah.
>> Right. So that right away I'm like,
okay, from a playability standpoint
already I'm like I might be leaning if
we're doing a fitting. Yep. I just felt
like I was swinging this one a little
bit more uh free.
>> Yeah. You were actually swinging it a
mile faster.
>> Yeah.
>> One other thing, too. Look at your apex.
You're hitting it over 20 ft higher.
>> Oh, wow.
>> Right. And it's not like you came into
the session cold. You must have hit 30
before we started to get going.
>> So, just that ping is helping you get
the ball in the air.
>> I struggle with that. And obviously
maybe due to spin or whatever, but yeah,
I usually don't launch it typically
super high.
>> Okay, I'm going to put that thing in and
give it a hit so I can compare uh the
two. see if I have drastic differences.
>> Cool.
>> When I look at Brandon's swing, man,
he's like so here,
>> so free and it's just a straight line
down to the ball. I take it back and I
get stuck and then I try to loop it like
and that's what causes like the toe
misses. But like he's like you like you
guys are just here and then it's just a
beline to the ball. I feel like I can
get a lot quicker if I just get cuz the
efficiency is there, right? It's just
overall thoughts on the ping. I like the
ping. I felt like I found closer to the
center of the face with it more often
than my gamer for sure.
Mr. Consistency,
I haven't seen you hit a bad one yet.
>> That's very nice of you, Brent.
>> I'm not paying you to be in this video.
>> No. No.
>> What is your golf? Is it the cut? Is
that what you usually play?
>> Yeah. It's funny. Like the start of the
start of the year, I was hitting like a
draw, kind of like a whooping pull draw.
Now I'm hitting more of a cut with that
mini driver. It's just like a little
baby fade.
>> I mean, with my drivers, I like to have
the ability to work it both ways. In
years past, I've hit drivers where I'll
try to like snap hook a driver and it
just stays out to the right.
>> Yeah.
>> And there's other drivers where I can
work it both ways. And for me, that's
what I like in a driver is its
workability.
>> Oh, yeah. I mean, if you can just hit it
down the center of the line every time.
>> I mean, I would be I would be okay with
that.
>> That's pretty good.
>> Oh, yeah.
>> I would say like from a feel standpoint,
it feels as hot as the Tailor Made.
>> Yeah. I've never hit a Ping drive. I I I
quite liked it for sure.
>> You know what? One of my favorite
drivers of all time going way back was
the Ping G10.
>> Oh, wow.
>> So, the five was like the little blue
one. The 10 was like copper. That's like
when I really got into golf. I had a
Ping G10 and I just like loved the way
that that thing
>> felt and sounded. And since then, like
I'll be honest, no Ping drivers have
ranked super crazy high in my brackets
in the past. They've always kind of been
middle of the pack. There's a ton of
people I talk to that are like, "Oh, the
440, that's like the best one they've
ever made."
>> Interesting.
>> Yeah, that felt hit the hardest. I think
that's going to go the furthest just cuz
it's lower spin and a bit of a bit of a
draw.
>> Yeah,
>> I'm okay with that. Let's the compare
our data. I like this grouping. So it
looks like I was actually hitting the
tailor made further.
>> Yeah.
>> Like I had this two kind of outliers
where you I guess you were pretty
similar distance-wise. Like it looks
like tail was going a little bit
further. Let's go into that. Uh how's
that for a session?
>> Yeah. Yeah.
>> Not awful. Okay. I was carrying the
tailor made further then I go to spin.
Right. 300 RPM higher. So it's just
ballooning a bit more. Right.
>> Yeah. Smash Factor was identical. It
looks like I was swinging the Tailor
Made faster.
>> So, like I'm not noticing huge
differences. For me, I would be leaning
more towards the Tailor Made probably
just from like a pure spin factor cuz
everything else was actually pretty darn
close.
>> You hit the center of the face on the
ping like every single one.
>> Well, and it wasn't going as far. Yeah.
Right. So, to be 330, 9 yards
difference. Yeah. And then again, the uh
grouping was very similar. Maybe
slightly tighter,
>> but you think for how like how many I
hit dead center on the top. You think
it' be closer to that line.
>> Single one of those here.
>> Okay, we got one more driver in this
heat, which is the Wilson. And then only
one of these drivers is moving on.
>> The Wilson. Okay.
>> Okay.
>> This is the one of the two most
affordable drivers in the field. I mean,
drivers are expensive. Everybody knows
that they're every year they go up and
no one likes to pay a lot of money. Not
that you're going to buy a new driver
every year, but if you're in the market,
if you haven't bought a new driver in 10
years, you're like, "Wow, these things
are like $300, $400 more than I, you
know, remember them being." Not this
one. Felix, my amazing editor, will
throw up the price graphic and uh we'll
know exactly how much it is, but a lot
of people like this driver. A lot of
people like this driver. It's like, "Why
don't you have the Dino Power? Why don't
you have the Wilson?" So, I'm excited
for us to both hit this. We filmed a
video a long time ago and I didn't like
their irons and the entire Wilson
community came out to poo poo in my
comment section.
>> Okay.
>> So, I'm gonna be careful what I say
about Wilson, but I'm hoping that this
lives up to kind of the baseline of the
other drivers.
>> Sure.
>> Well, just like your iron video because
you didn't like the how it looked
like
>> three swings on it. What are you
thinking so far of the Dino Power?
>> I don't love the way it looks when I'm
looking at it to be honest with you.
like looking down at it, it just doesn't
doesn't it's not appealing to my eyes.
>> What don't you like about that shape?
>> It looks a little bulky on the back.
Yeah, I I can't really pinpoint it
exactly. It's just doesn't it's not
appealing to me personally. It's not
appealing to me personally. It's not
appealing to me personally.
I actually don't like how this driver
looks at all either. Really?
>> No, I don't like how this driver. It
just feels like
>> it just it looks different. But I mean,
>> hey, those are your words. I haven't
been able to say anything yet. So,
comment section. Come for Brent.
>> Yeah.
>> Don't come for me.
>> Come for me again. It's okay.
>> Okay. Let's see it. I hope you murder
this driver.
>> 400 yards.
>> Yeah. Okay. Okay.
>> In the center of the club face.
>> It was interesting.
>> H.
>> That was outlier.
>> That That was the worst being like,
>> "Yeah,
>> screw this guy." That was totally the
club and not me.
>> Yeah, that was definitely not you.
>> That is the miss.
Okay.
>> Hey, what's the best course you've ever
played?
>> Best course
>> or best experience?
>> The best experience was when we with
some of our buddies went to Cabbat
Citrus Farms. Was that 2 years ago? Year
ago?
>> Two years ago.
>> That was obviously I'm not an amazing
golfer. I was way worse then, but it was
the best day, best experience ever from
when you got there to the the way they
took care of you, the way the course
was. Uh we we play 18, then we played
the executive nine, then we played the
par three and Jimmy, shout out to Jimmy.
>> Jimmy Jones.
>> Jimmy Jones. Uh he had a hole in one.
>> That was sick.
>> That was sick.
>> And there was like nine of us.
>> Yeah, it was amazing. So that was the
best day. And then we There's 16 of us
from our golf course, you included, that
went to Cabbat in Nova Scotia. People
are going to say that you're saying that
because I'm wearing a Cabbat hat, but
this is just mere coincidence that we've
both gone to Cabat twice. Cabba doesn't
pay me.
>> No. And that was the like it was an
awesome experience. I I like the course,
but I would just say like going with
like 16 buddies was
>> I mean you could go play a dog track
with 16 your best.
>> I could. So those were probably up
there. And then you can't go wrong with
any BC course.
>> What's your favorite course in British
Columbia?
>> I This is a hot take. This is a very hot
take. So, we go to Kimberly like three
times a year and there's Shadow
Mountain, which everybody likes. There's
Trickle Creek. There's Wild Stone, which
is awesome. My favorite is Bootleg Gap.
>> That's your favorite?
>> Yeah, I know. It's It's just I call it
the Colut of the Rockies.
>> Okay. Colut is like a dog track in our
house.
>> Yeah. But it's great. It's Yeah, I
really like it.
>> You've never played Greywolf?
>> I've never played I've never played
Greywolf. Yeah. And I've been out to
Inverir
>> 10 times. I just
>> You got to play Greywolf. That's by far
that's like in my top three. Everyone
says that. Well, I I'll have to We'll
get out there.
>> We'll go I'll treat you to a round.
>> Oh, Wilson. Middle of the
>> fair face. That's going to roll.
>> I mean, yeah, definitely not the height
that we want.
>> No, it's better than banging it off the
toe. But that way is actually pretty
good for a miss.
>> Okay, let me ask you a hypothetical
question.
>> Yeah.
>> Let's say out of all the nine drivers,
the one that you hit the best is the one
that looks the worst to you. You can't
miss a fairway. You hit it high and far,
but you have to get over the way it
looks.
>> I I take that every time. But I think
part of like hitting a drive for me
anyways, like the look of it and how it
looks at a dress maybe helps me hit it
better. I don't know. But if it was like
the most dog looking driver and I I
would pay five grand for it and I would
>> and and I would play it. So to answer
your question, yes.
>> I mean, there's I I agree with you. I
like I like like looking at my driver.
>> Yeah.
>> You know what I mean? Yeah. There's
people that have, you know, murdered my
comment section. It shouldn't matter. It
doesn't matter what it looks like. Yeah.
>> Yeah. I to me it does. I I think I I I
feel more confident if I'm standing over
it. For sure.
>> That was nice.
>> That was better.
>> Little towy, but
>> little towy.
>> The line better, right?
>> Y.
>> Okay. Moment of truth. Is it 50 yards
past the other ones?
>> No.
>> It's right on par with it. So, it is.
>> Look, you're right over top of both of
them. So, this is kind of a hybrid
between the Tailor Made and the Ping.
>> Yeah.
>> Very consistent from a distance
standpoint, right? Like very, very
>> consistent. Not as tight of dispersion
as the Ping, not as tight as the Tailor
Made. Didn't go as far as the Tailor
Made, but for it to be, you know, a
fraction of the price, it's holding up
with those two.
>> Yeah. I think if I had more time with
it, I I I didn't not like it.
>> Is it fair to say you liked it better
than you thought you would? I liked it
better than I thought I would. Looking
down at it, I I really didn't like it.
>> What do you like about it?
>> I don't know. I just feel I can't tell
you. It actually The head feels
>> Wilson hater Wilson.
>> Not a Wilson hater. Uh but it just it
looks a little bit smaller too to me. I
play like the Qi35 that I find the head
is actually quite large,
>> right? Yeah.
>> Which gives me just a tiny bit more
confidence that I'm not going to
completely miss it. So
>> let's look at those numbers. Carry 235
versus 240 237. So like rate on par,
right? Total 255 60. So not as long as
the other two.
>> Spin
>> 2000 was better than the tailor made.
Better than the tailor made. Not as good
as the Ping.
>> Yeah.
>> Right. That's all that stands out to me.
Okay.
>> Yeah.
>> Let me hit that and see if I see what
you're seeing or if I like it better
than you do.
>> Sounds good.
>> Okay. I think I kind of see what you're
saying. I think from like looking at the
sole of the club, it looks way better
than I thought it would.
>> The bottom looks awesome. I think
>> club would look.
>> Yeah.
>> Top down. You know, they're separating
the carbon crown and the face with two
different materials, and maybe that's
what you're not liking. Yeah,
>> I think it looks okay.
>> Yep.
>> I mean, it doesn't sound that much
different than the other two.
>> I'm kind of all over the place in this
session on this one. Yeah, they're going
to say, "You purposely you purposely
slighted Wilson."
>> Yeah. I I mean, I don't think I saw
anyone hit that ping driver center their
faces. I'll tell you that to go from the
ping to this, the ping felt way more
stable. Yeah. In like way more
consistent,
>> right?
>> I mean, I think that was your biggest
one yet.
>> Okay, let's take a look at the data.
Only one of these is moving on. Moment
of truth.
It's right there.
>> Yeah,
>> it is right there. Out of those three,
really, nothing stands out to me. I
think from a feel standpoint, the one
that I'm thinking felt the best was
definitely the ping. Carry 305 versus it
was actually going further carry with
the ping. I think it is correlated to
the spin
>> for sure.
>> 118 versus 119 121
>> cuz tails are built for speed and power,
right?
>> Which is why I hit it.
>> 330 versus 325 versus 321. So
technically it was from like a distance
and speed standpoint it was
outperforming the ping which is so funny
like what I felt and saw I was like
leaning towards the ping. I'm like oh
there's no way it was outperforming the
ping. Then you look here and it was you
know
>> four yards further total and then the
spin was lower. Yeah it was actually a
pretty decent session. Like I don't
there's there's no data to show me that
it's a bad driver. It would be
interesting if you hit the like the set
dead center of the face on the Wilson as
much as you did on the ping to see it
too because I I don't think you maybe
you did, but it didn't seem like you hit
it as good on the face.
>> Yeah. Like I was favoring the toe side
more with the Wilson. So that's you
know, you could argue that the Wilson
has even more potential than the ping
because the ping I was lighting up the
center of the club face. Let's see if I
can go back to that ping.
>> Look at that. like how many dead center
strikes I had and I actually had
>> worse data than more dispersion tow
down.
>> So Wilson was like sneaky, bro.
>> We were both kind of talking like I
don't know if Wilson can make it out of
here. I would say like for you with the
spin that you're getting I would knock
Taylor out.
>> Yeah, unfortunately everything in me
wants to keep them in. But no, I I think
I would agree.
>> So then we got to go between my Ping or
my Wilson. Oh my god, we could have a
huge upset round one.
>> I liked it's tough. I feel like I hit
the ping a little bit better to be fair.
>> I really liked ping for you. Wilson,
you're actually closer to the center.
>> Yeah,
>> you had perfect spin with the ping.
>> Yeah, the only thing I didn't like about
the ping, but I feel like I I would just
need to like figure it out a little bit
more was just I I it was leaking a
little more to the right than I'm used
to.
>> And that would be just a head setting
change. That would be that would be so
quick to change. You know what? I think
we're both in agreeance that the Ping
was a very very solid club. Very very
solid. Like I didn't have I had three
touching the line.
>> So if 50% of my drivers are touching the
line, that's the driver that I want to
play. And for you,
>> you had such tight dispersion. It was
just to the right.
>> I can make one steady move that over. So
why don't we, if you're in agreeance,
the Ping G440 Max is leaving us as the
winner of this grouping.
>> I would agree.
>> Okay, on to the next session. And that's
not to count out the tailor made or the
Wilson because we have one wild card.
>> Okay, so we still have six drivers to
hit. Wilson might make her back.
>> It could. Yeah. Okay, let's move on.
Let's keep hitting. Okay, Brent, we're
going to stick with budget drivers.
Okay, this is a driver everyone has seen
and or heard of, especially if you have
a Costco membership. This is the
Kirkland Signature. Okay, this is the
least expensive driver in the field. And
what do you think of it looks so far? It
actually looks pretty sick. If it just
didn't say Kirkland on it, I think it
would look like a sick driver.
>> I hate the Kirkland brand.
>> I just hate the Kirkland.
>> But I mean, the driver itself looks
awesome.
>> Yeah, I think so, too. You got six hits
for this to earn your trust.
>> Okay.
Decent start.
>> It's not bad. Actually feels like really
nice off the face,
>> does it?
>> Yeah, it does.
Peeler draw.
>> Little towy, but yeah. I mean,
>> it's a low spin, bro.
>> Still low. I find I mean, I think this
is common, too. When I hit it, I did hit
that slightly off the toe. I think it
does reduce the spin. And that's my
miss. And then
>> you got a freaking answer for
everything, buddy.
>> Yeah.
>> Just hit it high, straight, and far with
>> high, straight, and far. Okay.
>> It's that easy.
>> Look at that. See, all you have to do is
hit it high, straight, and far.
>> High, straight, and far.
>> 260, 2200 spin.
>> I like the Kirkland so far. Do you?
>> Yeah, I do.
>> More than the Wilson.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Way more than the Wilson.
Yeah.
>> Can you imagine showing up to the course
with a Kirkland head cover?
>> I couldn't do it.
>> You'd have to get a custom head cover.
>> I I actually like Kirkland balls, too,
but it's just something about I just
can't
>> I find like Kirkland, they just changed
their balls so often. Okay.
>> It's like there was a a year or two
where they had like it was like the the
Titleist lawsuit balls. They look like
identical probes and then they get sued
and then they cheat out and they spin
way too much. I just find like they're
so inconsistent. My dad was saying this.
He's like he's like I was playing
Kirkland balls and I don't know if it's
me or the balls but they were just like
short left and not spinning good balls
cuz I think
>> this year I mean we're going to do a
ball test later now that we have the
unicorn set up to like do actual
accurate ball testing.
>> But I think this year they're supposed
to be better than last year were junk.
So, if you play Kirkland balls and
you're not getting the results that you
want, it's just the inconsistency of the
manufacturing that they found in the
ball.
>> Just got to stop getting sued and
they'll be fine.
>> Just hit hard.
>> Hit hard. I just Yeah. I mean,
>> little sicey
>> little to the right. That's okay. That's
why you're here, Brent.
>> That's why I'm here. I mean,
>> you're not here to hit it dead straight
every time.
>> Yeah, I guess
>> you're here cuz every golfer in the
world does that.
>> Yeah.
>> A little leaky.
>> I actually like the strike. I just left
the face wide open. But I really liked
it.
>> I mean, consistent.
Incredibly consistent.
>> Yeah. I wish I could hit this center of
the face as much as you do. I mean, if
you want to hit the center of the club
face more, I just launched the New9 Golf
School, which is an online training
platform that any golfer, doesn't matter
your skill level, if you want to break
100, you want to break 90, you want to
break 80, I have a step-by-step road map
where anyone can learn to golf the way
that I do. And it really costs you like
one or two lessons. And you have it for
life. You can be at home lying in bed.
You go on your phone like, "How did
Brandon say how to stop slicing?" Oh,
yeah. I gotta do this. You can reference
those at any time. Put a link in the
description of this video. Thank you for
the shout out, Brand.
>> You're welcome. That's how I got down
from a 20 cap. So,
>> see
>> to what I am now.
>> That's what I am. Man of the people.
You're actually all done. I know that
you want to keep hitting this Kirkland.
>> I actually do want to hit one more.
>> But you got to save. You have to.
>> I'll save some strings. I'll save some
strings.
>> I mean, let's look at that grouping.
Kirkland. Okay. So, let me tell you
something here.
>> Sure.
>> See how this is the thinnest circle so
far? Is the Kirkland Signature the best
driver of your session so far?
>> It might. I mean, it felt the best,
>> dude. 238 carry.
>> Yeah.
>> 258 2,000 spin. I don't hate 2,000 spin
for you. No.
>> I mean, it's up from the 1600.
>> Yeah.
>> Right.
>> Okay, Brandon. Right now, I'm really I'm
hiding all the previous ones cuz we're
starting a new session, but I was
curious how this compared to the Ping
cuz that's the one that moved on, right?
>> Yes.
>> Ping was 240 to 238. They're pretty
close. 258 to 260. Again, pretty close.
is just the spin, right? You've had the
best spin so far with that ping. Yeah.
>> But like so close and this is like
probably half the price.
>> Yep.
>> Okay. Well, forget about the other ones.
We're starting a brand new session, but
it sounds like this was like Look how
tight that is, Brent. You're my high
handicap. You're my average golfer.
Average golfers.
>> Yeah.
>> I mean, they shop at Costco.
>> I like the Kirk and I wish I didn't do.
>> Okay, I need to hit this thing cuz uh
this seems to be like the your favorite
driver so far.
>> I think so.
I know you don't love saying that.
>> No,
>> man. I wonder I I have no idea who's
making their clubs cuz that that was
impressive.
>> It was Yeah, I liked it.
>> Okay, I need to hit this. I mean, I
agree that it looks really good.
>> And it looks great.
>> You would have no idea. You could hand
this to anyone on the driving be like,
"What is this?" They'd be like, "Ping,
tell me title list."
>> Yeah.
>> You know what I mean? Like you I don't
think you'd ever say Kirkland. Then
you'd say Kirkland be like, "No, no,
it's not a Kirkland." Okay.
I knew that was Towi. I was waiting to
see if it would come back and it kind of
just hung out there.
>> I might be wrong, but I for like good
golfers and fast golfers like yourself,
I don't know if the Kirkland is the I
think that's why you pay for the you
think
>> the higher ends. I don't know. For me,
it doesn't make it. I'm not as nearly as
fast as you. Right.
>> That was good.
>> I mean, like all those big the major
club manufacturers, the majority of
their customers aren't swinging it the
way I am. I'm probably in the 5% of
their customers. You know, everyone's
swinging it in in your range like a
stiff shaft regular. They're selling way
more stiff and regular shafts than they
are
>> X flex, right?
>> And even the guys on tour, a lot of them
aren't even playing the heads that they
sell on the rack.
>> Interesting.
>> They're all like modified heads.
>> Okay.
>> Oh, yeah.
>> Pretty good, man.
>> 125.
>> Kirkland. Holy Kirkland's sneaky, man.
Can you imagine Kirkland wins driver of
the year?
Yeah.
>> Let's see if I had as good a session as
you did.
>> Not as tight as you.
>> Yeah.
>> Right. So maybe what that's saying is
for your club head speed at, you know,
what were you averaging?
>> 100 miles. 95. 96.
>> 60. No.
>> Uh yeah. I think it was like around 90
something. Yeah.
>> Yeah. 96 miles an hour.
>> So good.
>> We didn't change the shafts. We didn't
change anything. Like just for that club
head speed.
>> Mine I obviously had more variance. I
think if I had my other tracers up, I
think I had tighter sessions with those,
right?
>> I would agree.
>> Averaging 303 carry, 321 total, spin
3,000. So, like not awful. No,
>> you know what I mean? Like I could play
around to knock a little bit of spin
off.
>> Y
>> I thought overall though, I was actually
pretty impressed with that that club.
334s was my longest. I I definitely hit
other drivers further. The next driver
that I have for us to compare is
who do you think it is? What do we got
left? We have Callaway.
>> Boom. Callaway.
>> Callaway it is. Okay. Sick. This is a
cool driver. I actually won this driver
off of Martin Borgmeer, world long
driver. He had guys on his channel and
he had to guess who was a pro golfer.
>> I saw the video
>> and I somehow snuck out the victory.
Spoiler alert. Convincing pro golfers
and world long drivers that I was a pro.
>> I saw that video. You actually you had
me I mean I knew but you hit it good.
>> No, I hit it like dog I don't
know. I don't know how I snuck it up.
>> Okay. This Callaway Elite lineup has
been really good. A lot of guys I know
are playing this. Sure.
>> It's already at 10 and a half degrees
and it has to beat out the Kirkland
which by the looks of so far you are in
love with. I did like the Kirkland.
>> Initial thoughts on the Callaway?
>> It's hard to say. I don't think I'm
particularly swinging this one very
well. I like the look of it. I wish I
could hit it the way I was hitting the
Kirkland. I felt like I was hitting the
Kirkland just a little bit better. So, I
mean, I think part of it is how I'm
hitting it.
>> H.
>> Yeah. You're just not vibing with this
one, right?
>> No. I mean, I don't want to blame it on
the club. I'm just kind of missing it
all. The
>> whole point of this video is to blame it
on the club.
>> Okay. Well, I mean, it's probably me and
not the club, but I mean, I'm just I
haven't even come close to the center of
their face. I've towed it a couple
times. I've healed it a couple times.
>> You did that on other drivers and
>> Yeah. it
>> I don't know.
Yeah, like
>> 1100 spin. Like way too low spin.
>> Yeah,
>> we got six.
>> I hit that one so bad.
>> Look at that. Look at that compared to
the Kirkland. Who would have thought the
Kirkland would have been that much
tighter, that much more consistent, that
much closer to the line
>> than the Callaway?
>> Yeah.
>> You know, like your spin was crazy crazy
low.
>> Sorry, Callaway. I did you wrong.
>> 1,800. I mean, it it actually wasn't
that much lower than the Kirkland.
Obviously, I'd like to see more with the
Kirkland, but like carry, you know, 10
yards almost 10 yards of both. Like,
that just was not a good session. No, at
all.
>> I did not hit it.
>> Let me hop in there and see how
>> Show me how it's done.
>> It works with with what I got going on.
>> Did you see Happy Gilmore, too?
>> I did. I thought it was good for the
first like hour, but the last half hour
was like ridiculous.
>> Yeah, weird.
>> It was It was solid. Like, it was
cameos. There's some decent like but the
last half an hour was just
>> I mean I think this actually looks like
one of the best.
>> I think it looks good. I wish I hit it
better. I think it looks awesome.
>> I mean low smash, crazy high spin.
That's why I like doing these tests
because we keep the settings on the same
for all of them.
>> Shaft doesn't change, head setting
doesn't change, just the heads we swap
out. So to get these types of results,
you think every driver on the same
setting should be simple and it's just
not that case, right?
>> Cutting a lot more than
>> Yes. Well, it's just like spinning a
ton, right? I think a lot of people
think when they get fit for a shaft,
it'll translate into every head. Since
I've already gone through a fitting on
the Elite, I know that it can perform
better. When I got fit, I had like a DM
on a whiteboard on the draw setting, the
elite head, nine degrees, and it
performed way better than this.
Unfortunately, the testing, we have our
own rules already, right? Yep. One
shaft, one head setting. I already know
that this thing isn't outperforming
everything just based on spin. So, let's
take a look just to confirm, but that's
my my first thought. I mean, for me, it
was actually dispersion wise better than
the Kirkland. So, that's interesting to
see. But the Kirkland was going further
because it was spinning less. Yeah,
>> the dispersion was actually pretty good,
but distance-wise, it was just like,
watch, I'll go I'll pull this up.
>> Yeah, it's
>> 3,300
>> significantly.
>> 3,300 versus 3,000. So, both drivers
were spinning high for me. This was
spinning more. And that's why you're
going to see the distance gapping. This
is kind of the the tough decision you
got to make. If it was between these two
drivers, do you want the one that goes
occasionally further and isn't as tight
to the line, or do you want the one
that's as consistent every time?
looking at those I would still pick the
Callaway over the Kirkland
>> just because it's more consistent where
you know if you didn't have these I mean
you just got two big outl
>> right okay we got one more driver which
is thexon
>> okay
>> okay potentially we could have a winner
in the sun
>> I hope I hit the ciron good cuz I cannot
choose the Kirkland I've actually heard
really good things about the strickson
[Music]
okay we ran into a bit an issue and I'm
sorry that this has been happening in
our driver brackets sometimes when you
work with this amount of equipment with
special screws that have to go into each
driver shaft cuz if you guys know every
club manufacturer has a different
adapter they should just make it
universal. The screw for the strixon ZXI
snapped so we can't get the screw out of
the head which means we can't put the
shaft on it.
>> Okay. We also had an issue with one of
our other drivers which is the tour
edge. That adapter snapped as well. So
what we're going to do is since we had a
wild card and we can hit the stricks on
the stricks on is going to automatically
be the wild card. Good.
>> Okay. So the wild card it's still going
to make it in the stxon's still going to
make it into the semifinal. Here is the
other issue. Because the sleeve snapped
for the tour edge. We have to use the
tour edge stock shaft. Okay. We're going
to put the Tour Edge in right now so we
can finish this bracket, move on to the
last three.
>> Sure.
>> Okay, Brent, I know it's been a
long-hitting day for you.
>> Yes.
>> But we are going to hit the Tour Edge.
This is another one of the more
affordable drivers. We got a Project X
in it. So, it's still a very similar
profile to the shaft that you have been
hitting.
>> So, I'm hoping that you can still have a
fair session with this.
>> Sure. Sounds good.
That
>> was a nice draw. Still low spin, man.
It's crazy how low spin you get.
>> I mean, it's funny is when I first
started golfing, I think I struggled
with like what every golfer does is like
too much spin slices like 4500 and then
I got like the complete opposite way.
So,
>> it's like there's so many factors that
can contribute to spin.
>> Has nothing to do with my nice golf
swing.
>> I like your golf swing.
>> Oh, thanks, man.
>> Here you go.
>> That was better. Still low spin, but
>> I mean, great efficiency.
>> Yeah. Smash Factor. It went far, too.
>> Yeah. Well, we like that one.
>> Almost 270.
>> I didn't know I was going to be picking
the Tour Edge and the Kirkland.
>> Tour Edge has a huge following. Does it?
Oh my gosh. Big on the Champions Tour.
>> This is like the first time I've ever
heard of
>> You never heard of Tour Edge?
>> I've never heard of They've been around
forever.
>> No. Uh like Sneaky. Very sneaky
competitive.
>> I think it looks nice, I think. Yeah.
>> They're hybrids. Like people swear by
their hybrids for years. Yeah.
That was a good one.
>> Do you prefer having that draw?
>> I don't know. When I'm playing like my
best golf, I'm just not even thinking
about it. I'm just swinging and just
hitting a little cut. So, I mean, I
would like it for like the distance cuz
obviously I don't hit it like super far
and obvious I I think the draws go a
little bit farther, but I I think I
would just like to play one consistent
shot shape.
>> That's fair.
>> Right. So, I think it looks cooler.
>> Oh, boy.
>> Yeah. Good finish. I like that tight
little draw.
>> Like to get that spin up, right? Like
it's just knuckling. You're losing so
much in carry just from the spin. So,
how does this compare for you?
>> I I don't know if there's a little
fatigue setting in, but I I actually
felt like I hit a few of them like
actually on the center of the face.
>> Tight session, man.
>> And I mean, my ball speed I think on
that one was like the lowest, but I mean
the session like
>> I mean what we're seeing in difference
when it gets long like that is just from
your longest to your shortest.
>> Yeah.
>> Right. So 232 versus 227 or 238. So the
Kirkland's still carrying more. 253
versus 258. I mean I think the Kirkland
buddy for you in this set has been
>> I I only Yeah. If I had to choose
between the three, it's like 100% the
Kirk.
>> 100%. Okay. So let's see how this Tour
Edge matches up in my session.
>> I thought this looks really good.
>> I think it looks good.
>> Right. This I would say looks like one
of the best drivers. I I mean the sole
is kind of boring. I don't like the
bottom, but the top looks great.
>> Oh, brand. Who Who should care what a
driver looks like? Go for Kour Edge.
>> I'm definitely just not getting the
speed that I have out of a lot of the
other drivers.
>> Sure.
>> Right.
>> I mean, feels really good. I'm not
having any speed. And then I rip on 122.
>> You're turning this one over to the left
a lot more than the other ones.
>> That is low smash. It feels efficient.
like it feels like it really comes off
the club face really well.
>> I mean, I would take tight draws every
time.
>> Yeah,
>> I think that's six. So, the first time I
was consistently left, which we haven't
seen in the other drivers. So, like if I
could take away one part of the course,
>> that's not awful. Pretty close
distance-wise. Let's go into my chart
here.
>> Carry 300 versus 298 versus 303. So the
Kirkland is still off the face. The best
carry total distance 318 316 321 and
spin is the big one. 2,800. So probably
the best spin
>> I've had out of them. But from a carry
total distance and consistency, I think
you and I are both in agreeance that the
Kirkland
>> is moving on this session. I would not
have picked the Kirkland.
>> No on paper.
>> No.
>> Right.
>> No. It felt good. Okay, we got our last
session to go and then uh we have our
semi-final bracket. Okay, cool. Second
to last driver. Cool. The title is GT2.
Heard good things about this one.
>> Your nemesis at Country Hills plays this
driver.
>> Hans. Hans Oct.
>> He is my nemesis. He smashes this driver
pretty well.
>> Yeah, he only goes OB like seven, eight
times around.
>> It kind of reminds me I mean on the
bottom anyway, it kind of looks like the
Kirkland.
>> It does look a lot like the Kirkland. I
think Kirkland really likes Titalist. I
mean, it's not a bad business model.
That's nice. It feels really good off
the face. I'm just not launching it like
the other ones, but it feels good.
>> I mean, tight session, dude.
>> Yeah.
>> Look how tight that is. That might be
the smallest circle that you've had.
>> Yeah. The big concern again was just low
spin, which is, you know, we're a broken
record. 1,600 low spin.
>> Yeah.
>> But the dispersion I thought was
awesome.
>> Yeah, it was good. And I actually really
liked it off the face. I I liked it
quite a bit. I wish I could hit it a
little bit better, but I I like it.
>> Let me hit it. I'm excited to hit the
GT2. I haven't hit it yet this year, I
don't think. Titleless GT2. It does look
a lot like the Kirkland.
>> It does.
>> Right. Did you find that it felt like
the Kirkland? I found the curly gun I
hit better. But I mean I I did like that
quite a bit.
>> Oh yeah.
>> I had the chance to hit your nemesis
Hans's GT2 the other day.
>> How'd that go?
>> I quite liked it.
>> Probably better than him.
>> I won a long drive with it.
>> Yeah.
>> 1,900.
>> Yeah. Surprisingly low spin for like the
more core head.
>> Yeah. Like this is kind of spin that I
would anticipate with even like the GT4,
even the three, but to get it out of the
two for me, I actually quite like that.
>> Oh yeah,
>> like ropes, man.
>> That's six.
>> That's six.
>> I mean, I think we both had really good
starts with the Titalist.
>> I think you hit that the best.
>> I think both of us had an awesome
session with the Titus GT2. Like close
to the line, incredibly consistent
distance. Yeah. And I think like some of
the furthest carry that I've got like
309 carry I was super happy with that
session with like a perfect spin for me.
For you too low I think. Right. Again in
a fitting we can change that but for me
that was like super optimal. Big fan of
the GT2.
>> Okay. We got our last driver. This is a
really tough headto-head. We got the
Cobra
>> DS Adapt X
>> 2000 spin.
>> 2000. Yeah.
>> Who's this guy?
Boy, I love the spin on this driver for
you so far.
>> I I like this driver so far.
>> Feels good.
>> Feels good. Yeah. I mean, it just feels
like it's stable on the face. I I mean,
I I think I towed that one, too. It I
like it. I've never I don't think I've
ever hit a Cobra driver
>> ever. Ever?
>> Really?
>> No.
>> Welcome.
>> Yes.
>> I mean, Cobra has won our driver bracket
back to the LTDX. Aerojet was hot. AJet
was in the final. I think we had
backto-back years of drivers in the
final. on the DS adapt was so good. All
they did was took basically the same
driver and have this new hoszle setting.
>> Really good session, man.
>> Yeah,
>> the couple that you caught on the
screws.
>> Yeah, I'm thrilled with that.
>> So, look, you're getting it further than
the titalist.
>> Yeah.
>> With not as tight dispersion, but like
still pretty good. It's not like they're
way out on either side, right? It's
starting to look like my dispersion.
>> Yeah.
>> Dispersion on that title is just so
good. And the Cobra was so good, right?
232 versus 226.
>> Yeah.
>> So hitting it on average way further,
right?
>> 5247 5 yards further.
>> Your spin jumped up
>> almost
>> 200 RPM,
>> right? Still again low for where we're
looking at,
>> but for you higher than
>> it makes a big difference when it
>> huge, man. That's like spin is so so
advantageous for you. The majority of
people are trying to knock spin off of
their drive
>> and for you we're trying to add spin
which is you know just just different.
Okay, I'm going to hit it. We're going
to end this out. I think visually the
shape is obviously a little bit more
like triangular. I don't know if you
noticed that too. The other ones seem
much more rounded. That's kind of
standard for Cobra. Like the LTDX was
like that. The Aerojet might have been
slightly more round.
>> Hello. Hi. Hello. That is good.
Oh, I don't know how we're going to
eliminate one.
>> 23.
>> Really good. Woo. That was a lot of
swinging. Are you swung out?
>> I'm pretty gassed. I'll be honest.
>> I'm glad we only did six hits of each.
Could have been more. Okay, last little
look at the data here to uh finish our
brackets. I mean, consistent. I mean,
Titalist was tighter, but let's take a
look and see if I was hitting them
further. So, my DS adapt was 307 versus
309. Wow. I was actually hitting title
list further on carry. 320. Wow. I
didn't think I was hitting the title
that much further.
>> And the ball speed was less. The spin
was low, a lot lower.
>> Yeah, I was just way less efficient with
the Cobra, but still really good
numbers, right?
>> 2,800 spin. So, I was actually spinning
the Cobra higher even though I was
turning it over. That GT2 and the two
like we got along really well.
>> You hit I think those two drivers were
your best of the
>> I don't disagree with that. I think it
would be unjust to remove either of
these drivers at this point in the
bracket.
>> I would agree.
>> Okay, let's do some final thoughts here.
>> Okay, that was a lot of drivers that we
hit today. I think we're both gassed.
>> I'm a tired boy.
>> What we learned in the first session is
we chose the ping to move on. Yeah.
>> Out of all of them. Okay. The second
session was the surprise of the day
which was the Kirkland.
>> Good old Kirkland
>> was going on. Right. We had issues with
the Shrixon. So the Shrixon made it on
just kind of by default cuz we weren't
even able to hit it and we want to give
it a chance to play in. Okay. The last
session between the Cobra and the Titus
were some of our best sessions that we
had.
>> So we started the video expecting four
drivers to go on.
>> With the hiccup, we're going to move
five drivers on.
>> Okay. Okay, so we're going to move on
the Ping,
>> the Kirkland,
>> the Srixon,
>> Y,
>> the Cobra, and the Titalist. The next
video is going to be our semi-final
video.
>> Okay.
>> After we hit all five, one's got to drop
out. Then we got to do headto heads for
the best four. And then the last driver
video is going to be the headto-head to
Crown, the best driver of 2025. I really
