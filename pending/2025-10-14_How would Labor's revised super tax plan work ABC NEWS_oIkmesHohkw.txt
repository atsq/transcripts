stepping up to the podium
>> everybody
>> for one superersized backdown.
>> This one has been difficult. It's been
contentious as you all know. We found
another way to deliver on our
objectives.
>> For two years, the treasurers tried and
failed to gain support for plans to pair
back generous superanuation tax
concessions, resisting calls to change
tax until now. Labour still plans to
double the tax on earnings on super
balances above $3 million. But it'll
introduce a new higher tax rate for
balances above $10 million. Caving to
critics, those thresholds will now be
indexed, and the new tax will no longer
apply to unrealized gains on assets like
properties that are held in a super
fund.
>> Today is indeed a humiliating day for
the treasurer, but it is a victory for
common sense.
Nearly 100,000 Australians will be
affected. But at the same time, the
government's boosting the super balances
for 3 million more. Increasing and
expanding the lowincome superanuation
tax offset, meaning workers earning up
to $45,000 a year will now get $810
deposited directly into their accounts.
>> That change set to kick in in 2027. And
by one uh realistic calculation, uh it
means about an extra $15,000
uh at retirement.
>> Whether it's enough to convince his
political opponents, it's too early to
tell. What we saw today was the
government announce a backflip on uh
their super legislation without much
detail about how their new proposal will
work. Today's announcement represents a
significant backdown for a treasurer who
spent more than two years steadfastly
defending this policy. His revised plan
will start a year later and raise
substantially less revenue than the
original model, but the changes have
been applauded by high-profile internal
critics, including former Labour Prime
Minister Paul Keating. Jane Norman, ABC
