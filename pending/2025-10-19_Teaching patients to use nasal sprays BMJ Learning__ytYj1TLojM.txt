of course they're nice to see you uh I
hear from your doctor that you've got
Troublesome hay fever yes I do okay and
it looks like your doctors prescribed
you a nasal spray
how are you getting on with that
are you working just yet but okay okay
all right
um can you show me how you use it sure
yes yes give me a demonstration
turn my head right back
all right okay thanks for that I I think
there's a few things we could improve
upon that would let you get more effect
from the medicine
very simply nasal sprays tend to look a
bit like this
there are one or two that also have a a
pump on the side rather than at the top
when you first get one of these when
you're about to use it take off the top
clearly when you first pick up a
prescription you may need to Prime the
bottle that means just pumping it once
or twice until it lets out a fine spray
of mist once you've done that it's ready
to use and you don't need to use that
again while you're on the same bottle so
when you come to taking it each day sit
nice and upright your head's slightly
forward and you want to get it well into
the nostril and aim largely backwards
and slightly to the side bearing in mind
that your nose mainly goes back rather
than up so well into the nostril back
and slightly to the side
give it a good spray
you'll feel the fluid inside the nostril
inside the nasal cavity that's fine just
let it sit there try to resist the urge
to sniff strongly because actually all
you'll do is swallow it if it runs a
little bit you can give a very gentle
sniff let it sit there for a for a few
seconds then head back up and you can
get ready for the other side same again
you'll feel the fluid still in the nose
but that's normal it'll take a minute or
two before that's that's is fully
absorbed
okay I think if you do that you may find
that you get a lot more value from the
nose spray
the dose for some sprays is two sprays
to each nostril once a day so I would do
one spray at a time then the other then
back to the first nostril then to the
second
other sprays you take twice a day so I
would do that morning and evening
I hope that's helpful
