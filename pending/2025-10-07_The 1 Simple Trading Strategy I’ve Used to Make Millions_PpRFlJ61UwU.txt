Hey, what's up guys? It's Ezekiel Chu
here. So, let me hit you with this. Most
traders don't fail because they are like
clueless. They fail because they kind of
like they over complicate the whole
game. They chase what? They chase green
candles and then they stack indicators
and then they pray that one of them
hopefully would work. All it does is to
bleed their account dry. Here's the
truth. You don't need like 10
strategies. You don't need like 50
signals. What you need is one simple
strategy that actually works. And today
I'm giving you exactly that. I call it
the sweet spot.
And this is the exact strategy that I
use to make millions. And it's better
tested with my students that is proven
to kind of like cut through all the
noise, right? And this locks you into
high probability trades. It gives you
clarity. It gives you precision and
profits without all the chaos. So you
don't have to like chase trades anymore.
You don't have to guess trades anymore.
You can forget about gambling. This is
simple. This is repeatable and it works.
So stick with me on this one because
once you see how the sweet spot works,
you never look at trading the same way
again.

Most traders think that trading is about
okay, I got to do more, right? It's all
about doing more. I got to add this. I
got to check this. I got to do that. No,
no, no, no. The truth is that it's about
doing what matters. And that's why I
created this, the sweet spot. This is a
simple way to lock into one high
probability trade that allows you to
trade with clarity. Now, before we even
talk about say entries, right? How do we
enter the trade? You got to first
understand the market natural flow
first. Every chart, every pair, no
matter what time frame it is, they all
moves in what? Waves of highs and low.
And here's the thing. Whenever say a
trend line, it breaks. Price doesn't
just what it sprint away from it like
for good, right? No, no, no, no. Like a
magnet, price always almost come back to
retest the area that it breaks from. So
that broken level is like what? It's
like unfinished business. So price wants
to revisit it before deciding its true
direction. This is why this part is
technically our what our map.
[Music]
So this is the map, right? And why is it
so? Because this zones, these breaks,
this retest, they show you where the
money actually is, where the money hide.
And these are what our opportunity
zones, right? So think of them as what
as sports where the market it shows you.
Okay, I give you a little bit of tip.
This is where it is right the it tips
you the hand it the trend shift the
break happens and then suddenly you got
a zone that is high probability this is
a place to stock like a stalker to stock
your setup here's how it works step by
step okay first you start on a higher
time frame so let's say if you are a
sculper right you're sculping so your
higher time frame would be what the 15
minutes time frame right or even the 1
hour time frame so it doesn't really
matter all right if you are a swing
trader Your higher time frame can be the
what the 4 hour, the daily or the weekly
time frame. So now as long as you are
looking at the bigger picture and then
you are trading in a smaller picture
after you got your time frame, you mark
the trend in the higher time frame. You
mark where price broke and then you mark
that retest zone. So that is what your
destination after seeing it on the
higher time frame where you have marked
the zone where the retest zone where the
breaking zone and the retest zone is
what likely going to be then you move
down the time frame. So for example if
your higher time frame is a 15-inut time
frame you can move it down to the one
minute time frame and let the market
prove it that it can take the move back
to that level itself. Now, here's the
thing. When price finally breaks back to
that zone, that is not your entry. All
right? Most people think, "Oh, it
reaches the zone. That is my entry." No,
no, no, no. That is your map, right? You
don't jump right in because it touched
because nine out of 10 times the market
will revisit that area before showing
its hand. And that's where most traders,
they get it wrong, right? They dive in
too early. So, no, you don't just dive
in, you wait. Timing is everything. All
right? So, now you got your map. You
have marked the breaking level. You
spotted the retest zone. Now, here's the
golden rule. The map shows you where,
not when. Timing is everything. The way
we nail timing is by what? Waiting for
the trigger.
All right. So now,
>> what is the trigger, Ezekiel? This is a
simple and is a repeatable confirmation
that tells you that the market is ready.
>> So, in my framework, that starts with
what? spotting the in this case the
lower high itself. In an uptrend it will
be what the higher low itself and then
waiting for the true break. So most
traders they see price touch the zone
they dive in. No no no what you need is
proof right? So we want to make it even
sharper. Price action give us two major
signals. First one is what the breakoff
structure which means that what the
market after making a higher highs
there's a break of structure right is
continuing in the same trend. The other
one is change of character. That's where
the market shift the direction. So now
from a from a higher high and then now
it starts to make lower high. When you
hunting your entry, you are waiting for
what? The change of character. So let's
say the downtrend keeps making what?
Lower highs, lower lows and then
suddenly price fails to make a new low
and instead it pushes above the previous
high. So that is a change of character.
That is the first heartbeat of a
reversal. So now here's one more thing
to make it deadly accurate. The fair
value gap. Think of the fair value gap
as the market leaving footprints in your
chart itself. So technically the fair
value gap is when you spot say one, two
or three candles moving in the same
direction whether they are bullish or
bearish direction and you notice that
the wick of the very first candle high
doesn't overlap with the wick of the
third candle low. What you get is a
clean untouched box area that is left
behind on the chart itself. Okay, here's
the thing. In actual fact, I mean fair
value gap can be a little confusing with
all the definitions and some definitions
the theory are not pinpoint perfect. So
the key is to what is to see a good size
in uptrend a good size bullish green
green bullish bar right that kind of
what start from the middle area. So the
opening the opening is around the middle
area of that consolidation that that
consolidation. It doesn't open near the
top. It's kind of open near the middle
and then it closes cleanly. It's a big
bar. It closes cleanly. So there's not
much of a wig at the top. It closes
cleanly. So it's not a wig such as
there's a top wick and it doesn't
becomes a bullish bar. So just it can be
a little bit of wig. It can be no wig.
It's a good long bullish bar. And that
closes what? Above the bodies. Not
necessarily the wick of the previous
high. it can be above the bodies of the
previous highs bars around the left hand
side. So that itself would be considered
a good fair value gap. Now that you have
lined it out all up, quick pause. If you

Okay, now so now let's get back to it.
You got your map. All right, we recap.
You got your map. You got a retest zone.
So then you see what? So for example,
let's say downtrend, right? And all of a
sudden trend line for example. Then
after it broke through the trend line,
you got your retest zone, right? Then
you see a change of character down
change uptrend, break off the higher
highs, break of lower highs, all
suddenly you break the highs. Then what?
Then you spot a fair value gap forming.
So all these stacks up and when that
happens that is your sniper shot. That
is your sweet spot of entry and that is
your high probability area that you got
to go in. Now it's time to execute the
trade. So the cleanest way to do it is
to enter where? Right at the break line.
But of course make sure that the break
is true, right? It's a real line. It's a
breaking real breaking level. You put
your stop loss below the structure and
then target the retest zone that you
mapped earlier. You you may say okay
what if I miss it that's trading
>> is okay what if I miss the trade you
know I'm not always there at the market
itself what if I miss the trade
>> that's normal right the market will
always give you a second chance another
chance there's always opportunities like
that coming along so the key is not
chasing it when the market has taken off
and then you start chasing it oh
>> I better get in right now because uh is
you say this is a good trade but I
missed the entry point I better get in
right now no when it's gone it's gone
you wait for the next trigger because
why and here's the thing you got to Take
note, one perfect entry would beat 10
random ones. You got the trigger. The
next question is, now I'm in a trade.
How do I actually milk the trade for all
it's worth? And that's where we move
into the final piece, the money machine.
Technically, this is where the framework
where it turns good entries into
consistent profits. So the first rule of
the money machine is that your stop loss
is like a sacred area. It's a very very
important area and always plays it
beyond just beyond the structure itself
because the structure is the proof. If
price breaks back and beyond it the
market has spoken that your trade idea
is wrong and you respect that that small
it's not very big right that small
controlled stop loss keeps you in the
game to hit your next week spot. It
keeps you in the game in the long run
and always there ready to take on the
next sweet spot. So now the next thing a
symmetric risk. Forget about being right
every single time. You know most traders
they hop on that right? Uh oh man I make
a loss again. Oh no I'm wrong again. Oh
no I'm wrong again. No no no no no.
Forget about being right every single
time. You don't need to. One good winner
based on our trade setup should pay for
five small losses. And that's the game.
So for example, we aim for what at least
at least one is to three or one is to4
risk-to-reward ratio. So for example, if
you risk $100, you aim for $400,
something like that. So that way, even
if you are wrong three times in a row,
one win covers it all and more. Once
price reaches and hits your first
target, which is usually the retest zone
that you have mapped earlier. Okay, now
you got a choice. Do you take all profit
or do you let it run? So here's the
smart move. Scale out. close part of the
position to lock in profits and then you
let the rest ride. Right? So that way
you get paid no matter what. You also
give the trade room to turn into
something massive. This is where trade
management becomes an art. You can trail
your stop move it just below each lower
high or lower low itself if you are
going long. This way you are protecting
your profits, right? So giving the trade
enough oxygen to grow. So if the trend
keeps running, you ride the wave. If it
snaps back, you walk away still being in
the green itself. Say you risk $500. You
catch a sweet spot. You enter and price
rockets and then you trail smartly. So
by the time you are out, for example,
you have made say $3,800 from your $500
of risk. That is a 7.5 risk-to-reward
ratio trade. So remember, just one sweet
spot entry like this can, for example,
make 7.5 risk-to-reward ratio. That is
enough to cover all the multiple small
losses and allow you to stay
consistently profitable. Now, here's the
beauty. You can afford to be wrong what
five, six, seven times after which and
still be up even big time. And that is
how consistency is built. So, here's the
secret that most traders they never get.
Okay? Sometimes the best trade is no
trade. If your setup does not hit all
three pieces, the map, the trigger, and
the money management, skip it. Because
one clean high probability trade, like I
said, can pay more than 10 random steps
in the market itself. Even with say you
got only got a 50% win rate, consistent
application of this setup is going to
give you a real positive result. Not
just positive, like big results over
time itself. So the money machine is not
about gambling or is it luck, it's about
creating a what? A repeatable system.
Small risk, big winners. Lose small, win
big. And that is our mantra. Good. Okay.
So, here's what to do next. I want to
give you something that's going to
change the way that you trade forever.
So, I've put together a free training
that walks you through the exact
three-step system that I use to find
high probability trades with sniper
level entries, real risk control, and
zero guess work. So, this is the same
system that I use myself and the same
one that has helped thousands of traders
go from frustration to consistent wins.
And I'm giving it to you for free.
Right? There's no fluff, no fueler, just
pure strategy. So, if you ever wanted to
