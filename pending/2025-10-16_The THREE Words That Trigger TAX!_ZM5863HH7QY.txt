Three small words hidden in legal talk
can make your gift much smaller. These
are the words to remember and avoid. But
there's too many traps. So what do you
need to do in your will? You will need
to give in. When you leave something in
your will for family or the causes you
believe in. It's not just about money.
It's your final act of love. A way for
your care to live on beyond your
lifetime.
Three small words hidden in legal talk
can make your gift much smaller. Not
because someone is greedy, but because
of tax. If a will uses the wrong
wording, the law will whip your kindness
with tax. And that small difference can
cost up to 45% in tax. So in this video
I will make sure you don't make that
mistake and what you've built reaches
every life you hope to touch. In
Australia we don't have inheritance tax.
So when someone passes under their will
assets often can move to family members
and other beneficiaries tax-free. But
wording matters. If not careful, the
wording can instruct sales and attract
taxes before the money reaches anyone.
Thankfully, there are ways to keep an
inheritance tax-free. But the law needs
the right wording. Imagine an investment
property you bought for $300,000 in the
'90s, now worth $1.5 million. If you
give the property to your daughter Laura
in the will, she will receive the
property without any immediate tax. But
if your will says sell and give $1.5
million to my daughter Laura, the
executive has to sell the property, that
$1.2 million appreciation in the
property value is taxed as capital gain.
So now Laura will receive a lot less
than $1.5 million.
As you can see the same asset just
different words can give completely
different outcomes.
These are the words to remember and
avoid sell and divide or any variation
of that you often see in a wheel like
the executive is empowered under this
will to sell and call in and convert
into money. Realize my estate and
distribute the net proceeds to blah blah
blah. It sounds practical and easy for
your children because they tell your
executive to dispose of the asset and
just send cash to the beneficiaries.
However, a sale means tax. Unless this
is your main residence, most assets will
attract tax. But it does not end there.
The story can get worse. Often after you
have taken care of family and friends,
the residual you want to give to charity
and make the world a better place even
after you are gone. Actually, some of
the biggest Australian foundations like
Felton Bequest or the Sydney Mayer
Foundation are established under a will.
Well, back to the main issue. Donating
to charity in your will needs careful
consideration.
This is because donating when you are
alive, you get a tax deduction if the
charity has deductible gift recipient
status. However, once you pass away, the
donation from your deceased estate will
not get a deduction. Moreover, if you
donate other asset instead of cash, uh
you will trick uh CTT because you are
consider disposing of the uh asset and
market value. But remember, you get a
deduction. So you end up not paying any
tax. However, donating assets in your
will, the deceased estate will also be
taxed on capital gain under CGT event K3
with no deduction to reduce it unless
these organization have deductible gift
recipient status in which case the gain
can be disregarded. Uh gift recipient
status can easily be checked. just go to
ABN lookup and you search the name of
the organization uh in the report you
will be able to say if they have a
deductible gift recipient status or not.
One mistake you really want to avoid is
leaving assets in your will to a charity
that is tax exempt but does not have
deductible gift recipient status. What
does that mean? It means your estate
won't get a tax deduction for the
donation and worse it may have to pay
capital gains tax on the gift itself.
That tax bill can easily undo your good
intentions. For example, imagine you
want to leave a piece of land to friends
of Mary Creek because rare birds live
there. But since the charity isn't a
deductible gift recipient, the estate
must pay CGT on the land's value. If
there's no cash left in the estate to
cover the tax, the executive have to
sell the property and only send what's
left to the charity. The result, a
generous act of love gets tangled in tax
and may never reach the cause you cared
about. And the worst scenario is a
force. The wordings issue that I
mentioned above. If um your will say
something like the executive is to sell
and convert into money the residual
estate and be with the money to vision
Australia.
In this case the estate uh needs to sell
the asset under your command in the will
before they can send money to the
foundation. There are no concessions to
CGT regardless if Vision Australia has
deductible gift recipient status. This
is because the deductible gift recipient
concession only apply if you give the
asset directly to the organization. Uh
if you give the asset directly, the
charity will receive the full value. No
tax, no loss. So just pure generosity.
So far there has too many traps. So what
do you need to do in your will? You will
need to give enough discretion to the
executive or the legal personal
representative. It will ensures your
philanthropy wishes are carried out in
the most effective way. If your heart is
set on a nondeductible gift recipient
organization, there are gentle
workarounds. You could leave a cash
amount that you are certain is available
for donation or gift the asset to the
deductible gift recipient partner of
that organization that formally supports
the same mission. For instance, a
foundation that funds the same community
group. Uh with careful drafting, your
gift still lands exactly where you want
it to be uh without forcing a
taxdedriven sale. Now, here's the recap
of how to keep your legacy taxfree. And
last thing, first confirm the charity is
deductible gift recipient endorsed.
Second, using words like I give my
property as this address to charity name
with this ACN.
Authorize your executive to transfer
assets directly and not selling them and
ask your lawyer and accountant to make
sure there are no hidden tax surprises.
