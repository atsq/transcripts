Welcome back everyone it's Charlie
look at what they've done
to my boy Henry Cavill.
This is Liam Hemsworth in
the first look of him as Geralt
of Rivia replacing Henry
Cavill on the Witcher season 4.
I'm sure there are a lot of you that
thought that Netflix actually forgot about
the Witcher because they have not said
anything about this since they announced
that Liam Hemsworth was taking over for
Henry Cavill.
It almost seems like Netflix tried to
sneak this trailer out when everybody was
away because it was
Saturday night like other off
doing stuff they won't
notice that we dropped it.
It is going to take a hot minute to get
used to this for the last two seasons
because they've
already started filming the
Witcher season 5 and
that will be the last season.
You can kind of tell the
way they release this they
don't want to focus too
much on the actual dialogue.
They just want to show you a quick action
scene.
To show you how they polish the special
effects.
Like please don't focus on the fact that
it's Liam Hemsworth and not Henry Cavill.
Just look at the cool special effects.
Kind of seems like things behind the
scenes with the Witcher are a total mess.
So we will see how it all goes down.
If you're brand new to the channel be sure
to subscribe to get the videos.
I know they're gonna be a ton of questions
about why Henry Cavill left.
What's he doing now with his Warhammer
series and movies.
What's he doing with the Highlander movie
that he's filming.
It just got delayed because he got
injured.
But he's still making that.
And there are many many other things that
Henry Cavill is doing right now.
So don't feel bad for Henry Cavill.
He's actually living his best life right
now.
Also he's in a live-action Voltron movie.
That's right live-action Voltron movie.
To his credit Liam
Hemsworth even though he is
the lesser Hemsworth
brother is a nice dude.
But it just feels like a complete mess
behind the scenes.
So it seems like the Witcher
is probably going to be
a slow-moving train wreck
for the last two seasons.
But that just means it's going to be done
relatively quickly.
They'll probably release season five.
Next year and then that'll be it.
Close the book and then we will never
speak of the Witcher Netflix again.
What did it cost?
Everything.
In the actual clip if you couldn't tell
this is Geralt versus the Wraith and it
looks like he's with Zoltan the dwarf and
Milva the hunter with her bow.
You notice he uses
his silver sword because
silver is for monsters
for Wraiths like this.
His regular sword is for humans.
That's the whole idea.
One for humans one for monsters.
You notice.
When he summons the Wraith he uses his Ard
sign to knock himself back away from it.
He also uses the Urdan sign to trap it.
The Urdan sign also
makes it corporeal so he
can physically attack
it with his silver sword.
Then he rips out its heart and it turns to
dust basically.
You can harvest death dust and ectoplasm
from Wraiths.
He fights them in the games and in the
books.
Then they flash the new pendants.
I couldn't quite make out the symbols on
his pendants.
It starts out with one which is destroyed
revealing one underneath.
If you didn't read the book.
Season four and five the last two seasons
will adapt baptism of fire the tower of
the swallow and lady of the lake with some
video game stuff thrown in because there's
some stuff that they do in the games that
picks up after the books end.
All the stuff where Ciri
actually fights the white
frost that is purely from the
games not from the books.
And the elder blood the reason
why Ciri is so powerful her whole
line the reason why she
exists is to defeat the white frost.
So obviously they want
to adapt a version of
that for the TV show but
they've already changed.
Some of the white frost
storyline to make it seem like it's
a character that we met
during the witcher blood origin.
So I'm also expecting a lot of changes
from what we actually saw in the games.
If you played through the last witcher
wild hunt game the author Andre Sapkowski
is also writing a new witcher book but I'm
assuming that none of that is going to be
incorporated into the last two seasons
because they're basically almost done
filming all of the witcher season five and
a lot of the reports are saying they're
using a twist with the Nimue character
from the books.
To actually explain.
Why he looks like Liam Hemsworth and not
Henry Cavill anymore in the context of the
books Nimue eventually tells the story of
Geralt and his companions many years after
they passed away like many years into the
future.
So by Nimue's time all the characters have
become legendary many versions of their
story exists with many different
interpretations when people tell different
versions of the stories about
Geralt and his friends this is
how they're explaining why
he looks different and looks like.
Liam Hemsworth.
He looks like Liam Hemsworth
and not Henry Cavill because in
the version of Geralt stories
that Nimue tells he looks like.
Liam Hemsworth these are not them.
You've captured.
Nimue the character doesn't really show up
to little bit later in the overall book
story serious runs into her while she is
trying to find her way home to her world
and Nimue helps her but I think they're
actually introducing Nimue earlier in the
seasons on The Witcher Netflix
so they can set up this whole
storytelling twist where she
tells Geralt and series story.
And in the end it's very interesting.
And in that version of the story,
he looks like Liam Hemsworth.
Baptism of Fire is
largely Geralt trying to
find Ciri, who is now
on her own with the rats.
We just saw that briefly at the end of
season 3.
She continues to have more visions of the
Wild Hunt.
He then meets Milva the Hunter,
healing his wounds from the fight with
Vilgefortz, meets up with Zoltan from the
Dwarves, and eventually meets Regis the
Vampire, who's being played by Laurence
Fishburne.
While this is going on, Cahir comes back
and the story entails him.
But Yennefer gets captured by Francesca,
then the Lodge of Sorceresses forms after
the Theanid Coup at the end of season 3 in
the fall of the Brotherhood of Sorcerers.
The Lodge seeks to use Ciri and
her power for their own personal
gain because they want magic
to reign supreme in the world.
Vilgefortz still wants Ciri, then Leo
Bonhart the Bounty Hunter goes after Ciri.
So all these different
forces on the show,
different factions, want
Ciri to use her power.
Tower of the Swallow is a reference to Tor
Zeriel.
Ciri believes that she can use the portal
inside the tower to take her back to
Theanid, away from everyone that's hunting
her.
And remember, there are a lot of people
that are hunting her.
What winds up happening, though,
is the portal takes her to the elven world
of the Ain El, which we
saw during the Witcher
blood origin in the
Origin of the Wild Hunt.
Also maybe the Origin of the White Frost,
too, technically.
The show's version of the White Frost.
Ciri actually saw a vision of her
ancestor, Laura Doran, who was the
beginning of the Elder Blood program,
that the Ain El started.
She fell in love with
the human mage, which
is how the Elder Blood
line passed to humans.
The elves previously planned for it to
stay in their line only.
The whole reason why the
Elder Blood program exists
in the first place is to
stop the White Frost.
So my assumption, just based on the way
that Netflix paces these seasons out,
and season 5 will be the last season,
is that season 4 will end on a
cliffhanger, with Ciri walking through the
portal in Tor Zeriel to the elves' world,
and season 5 will just pick up with her
stuck in the elves' world.
The actual title of the final book,
The Lady of the Lake, refers to Nimue,
who Ciri runs into
while searching for a way
to get back to her
world through the portals.
Nimue helps point her in the right
direction.
Then all that book story actually ends
before Ciri fights the White Frost.
All that stuff is directly from the
Witcher 3 game.
Avalok gave me a choice.
I made the decision.
I must stop it.
There's gotta be another way.
All the events of the Witcher video games
pick up after the end of the last book.
This is why they have to adapt some of the
video games, because they're building up
to Ciri stopping the White Frost,
which previously they've teased is Falka,
from the Witcher blood origin,
who survived.
In the books, she's also this big
antagonistic force that they talk about.
But like I said, the books never actually
dealt with Falka as the White Frost,
so this is something that the show is
doing different from the books.
This is also why during the Witcher season
3, you saw all those scenes of Ciri trying
to deal with Falka, who was trying to twist
her for her own ends and gaslight her.
She also wants to use Ciri's power.
Most of the stuff about Falka
being the White Frost, though,
seems like it came from the
Witcher blood origin TV show.
Also, cool side note, because she mentions
Avalok during that clip, we actually saw
Avalok in the Witcher blood origin
post-credit scene getting ready to talk to
Ciri at the beginning of the Witcher
Netflix TV show timeline.
There's a lot of time travel in the
Witcher stories.
But it's also really relevant right now,
in particular, because the actor who plays
Avalok in the Witcher Netflix universe
also stars on Alien Earth as a major
character, and it is
just a vastly, vastly
better show, which I'm
also doing videos for.
So be sure to watch those if you haven't
started already.
Like I said, it could wind up being a
total train wreck for the last two
seasons, but it will be
the last two seasons, so
we won't have to talk
about it after season 5.
Alright, we're here.
Let us never speak of the shortcut again.
There was supposed to be a Witcher Rats
spinoff show for that group that Ciri
winds up with at the end of season 3,
but reportedly, it was an even bigger
disaster than the Witcher season 4 and
season 5 with the Liam Hemsworth switchover.
Like, if you thought that what was
happening with that with the Henry Cavill
switch was bad, then whatever happened
with the rats is just vastly, vastly worse.
So I think the idea is that Netflix
truncated whatever their original plan
was, like they just edited it down to
death, Witcher blood origin style,
and they'll just treat it like they did
with the Witcher blood origin,
where they treat it like its own little
thing and it's just a smaller version of
what they originally planned, and then
just hope that everybody forgets about it.
Like they'll never mention it again.
So maybe, maybe there
will be like one more Witcher
spinoff and maybe more
Witcher animated movies.
The animated movies that they've done have
actually been pretty solid, like they
brought Doug Cockle back who voices Geralt
in the games to do the animated movies.
That is why it sounds way more accurate to
the actual video games.
It looks like they're releasing the entire
season all at once on October 30th.
They're not going to do like a break in
the middle of the season like they are
with Stranger Things later this year,
or they did with The Witcher Season 3.
So there'll probably be a much bigger
story trailer in the next couple of weeks.
But if you spotted any other Easter eggs
or references in this teaser trailer that
I didn't talk about during the video,
or you have other questions about how
they're going to wrap up The
Witcher story for the Netflix
series just in general, just write
them below in the comments.
I've already done a couple videos about
Henry Cavill's Warhammer series and the
other stuff he's working on, so I'll link
it at the end of this.
He is really living his best life.
Once we actually start getting some
footage for that Warhammer TV series,
I will start doing some more videos for it
regularly.
Everybody click here for
that Henry Cavill Warhammer
trailer, and click here for
all my other Witcher videos.
Thank you so much for watching,
and I'll see you guys in the next one!
