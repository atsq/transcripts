If you think creatine is just for
bodybuilders trying to get bigger
muscles, you're missing out on one of
the most powerful, wellressearched
supplements for your brain. For years,
we put creatine in a box labeled sports
performance. But the science is clear.
This molecule is a critical tool for
anyone interested in cognitive function,
fighting brain fog, or protecting your
brain at any age. So, what is it? Think
of creatine as a recharger for your cell
batteries. Every cell in your body runs
on ATP, a molecule of energy. When you
use ATP, it becomes a drain battery
called ADP. Creatine's job is to swoop
in and rapidly slap a new energy unit
onto that ADP, turning it back into the
fully charged ATP battery. Your brain
and your muscles are the most energy
demanding tissues in your body. So,
keeping them saturated with creatine is
one of the best things that you can do
for your physical and mental
performance. But I see so many people
taking it wrong, wasting their money,
and complaining about the side effects.
So, let's go over the correct way to
take creatine. First, let's talk about
the dose. If you only care about your
muscles, a daily dose of about 5 g will
work. But if you're like me, you care
about what happens from the neck up. Our
brains are very stubborn about letting
things into it. To get creatine past the
bloodb brain barrier and see that real
cognitive benefit, the best studies use
a loading phase of 20 grams per day for
at least the first week. Now, that
sounds like a lot, and it is. That's why
you have to titrate up. After you've
loaded for a week, you can drop it to a
maintenance dose. I take 10 grams a day
and make sure I'm checking off all the
boxes for my muscles, bones, and brain.
I actually shoot it with my methylene
blue. We'll get to that later in the
video. Next, protect your gut. This
brings me to the most common complaint I
hear. Dr. Bos, creatine gives me an
upset stomach, aka diarrhea. There's a
simple reason for this. Creatine is
osmotic, which means it pulls water into
the area that it exists, like your
intestines. If you chug it like I did,
that sudden rush into your gut can send
you trottting to the toilet. Lesson
learned. Drink it slowly. Sip on it over
10 to 15 minutes. Don't chug it. Second,
take it with food. Having a meal in your
stomach helps to buffer that osmotic
effect and it slows down the absorption.
And don't waste your money. I see people
waste money on creatine in two ways.
Let's start with buying the wrong kind.
You walk into a supplement store and see
dozens of different forms, all claiming
these unique benefits with huge price
tags. Watch out. The most studied,
proven, and cheapest form is simple
creatine monohydrate. It's the gold
standard for a reason. Don't pay extra
for marketing hype. Now, let's talk
about wasting the creatine you just
bought. There's evidence that dosing
creatine and caffeine at the same time
can hinder performance. They have
opposing actions on how your muscle
handles calcium. This conflict really
only seems to matter at the high doses
of caffeine, like over 250 milligrams.
That large coffee from Starbucks might
be a problem. To be safe, I don't mix
them. I have my creatine in the morning
and about 45 minutes later, I get my
coffee. Now, let's bust a few myths that
scare people away from one of the safest
supplements on the planet. First,
creatine makes you fat. That's false.
Creatine pulls water into your muscles,
not your fat cells. That water is pulled
in by that osmotic effect when you first
start taking it. So, you might see that
number on the scale go up a few pounds
in the first week, but it's water weight
inside the muscles. It's a sign that
it's working. It's not fat. Creatine
causes hair loss. This myth comes from a
single study found years ago that
creatine might slightly increase the
hormone DHT, but it stayed within the
normal limits in the healthy range. And
that study never even measured hair
loss. Creatine is bad for your kidneys.
This is the most persistent and
dangerous myth. In dozens of human
studies on people with healthy kidneys,
creatine has been proven to be
completely safe. In fact, the safety
profile extends even to populations
where organs might be under more stress,
like post-menopausal women or those with
type 2 diabetes. Studies have
consistently shown no evidence of
creatine causing kidney damage. The
confusion comes from a lab test.
Creatine supplementation will increase
the waste product called creatinin in
your blood. An uninformed doctor might
see that number and think your kidneys
are failing, but it does not mean your
kidney function is actually declining.
The standard test to check your kidneys
called the estimated glomemeular
filtration rate uses your blood
creatinin level in its formula. Because
your creatine supplements directly and
harmlessly increase your creatinin, it
artificially inflates one of the key
variables in that equation. This can
make that final GFR result look falsely
low, creating a false alarm that your
healthy kidneys are damaged. If you're
worried about this, you need a better
test. Insist your doctor order a
cistaten C test. Cistatin C is a protein
produced by almost all cells in your
body at a very constant rate. And the
critical difference between this and the
other test is its production is not
affected by factors like your muscle
mass, a high protein diet, or creatine
supplementation. And the bonus myth is
acidic drinks destroy creatine. You hear
people say you can't mix creatine in
coffee or sour sports drinks because the
acid will break it down into useless
creatinin. This is technically true, but
practically false. Yes, creatine will
eventually break down in a strong acid,
but the process takes days. The few
minutes that your creatine sits in your
morning coffee before you drink it, it's
not going to do a thing. Your stomach
acid is far stronger and your body has
no problem absorbing the creatine before
it has any chance to degrade. So, what
do I mix with my creatine? Well, I stack
my brain supplements. And the second on
the list is methylene blue. Click here
