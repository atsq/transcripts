The lifelong question. Does size matter?
Trevor, does it?
I'm blushing. Does grip size affect
performance? Today, we're going to test
standard, midsize, and then the crazy
crazy jumbo Bryson Dshambo type grip.
I'm the perfect candidate to test this.
You know why?
Why?
Cuz my nickname is WFG.
They call me the wrist flipping son of a
gun. I just get real flippy with those
wrists and I just turn that club face
over and I get real snap hooky. I want
to know, will a bigger grip help fix
that problem?
Will it stop it?
It's an easy acronym. Rolls right off
the tongue.
WF OG.
So, let's test them. Let's see if this
will get me closer to the center line.
That's what I want to know.
So, what are we going to test? You're
going to hit shots with each club and
we're going to test it dispersion off
center line.
Yep. Exactly. So, I have my ZX7s. I have
a midsize and then a tester Bryson grip.
The Jumbo Max Light.
Jumboax Zen Light M. This is a standard
versus a midsize.
Not a huge difference. This is a plus4.
So when you see plus4, it means it's not
as tapered. So this is just a standard
tapered club. This has like extra four
wraps on the bottom technically, so it's
less tapered. So that on the right hand,
your low hand, it's going to be closer
to the same size as your top hand versus
this is a fully tapered club. I mean, it
gets like almost down to the width of
the shaft. This is standard
versus this crazy jumbo looking thing.
That's a big difference. I have some
concerns with this that I'll get to.
This is when it starts to feel real
weird. Going to a midsize is not that
big of an adjustment. I think you could
adjust pretty easy, but going to that is
pretty big. Should we start with
standard?
I think so.
Get a good baseline.
I think so.
So, that's my miss right there. Okay.
That's why I've been tinkering with the
midsize grips is when I called myself
the WFOG.
It's because when I'm here, I'm closing.
See, I got 4° club face closed with that
standard grip. I want to track the data
and see if that club face stays a little
more open.
With too small of a lower hand, your
your draw is turning into a hook.
Yeah, like that one's better. I can fix
some of that in my grip, which I've been
working on a little bit.
Got to hike your pants up a little bit.
Color of your underwear makes it look
like your butt cracks hanging out every
shot.
I didn't wear a belt today. I got rid of
my skinny jeans, you know, cuz skinny
jeans aren't cool anymore.
Yeah. So now I got like the cool kid,
you know, just straight leg,
you know, like '9s style.
Yeah, it's hot.
It's cool, huh?
Yeah, it's sick. I don't think the kids
are saying sick anymore either.
No, they say bet.
Oh, yeah. Say more.
Say that's that's the miss. What else
they say? They say uh
say less.
Fire.
Yeah,
they say fire. That means good.
Riz means spitting your spitting game at
a girl.
Spitting game. Like if you have good RZ
means you can talk good good game to the
What is RZ short for
beats me?
See that one I straightened out a little
bit. Still going to finish left of
center. Nope.
No, it's going to fit on center. What's
your goal? Like what what's your what is
an appropriate offline for you? A yard
two yards. Thinking
my goal is stripe stripe city.
Laser laser beam city.
Okay, I can see that.
Okay, so John Dailyaly is quoted as
saying, "The bigger the grip is, the
better you're going to play. Get fitted
with your grips, not your clubs."
The smaller the grip is, if you put your
hands on a grip and you take it back and
there's no gap between your left arm and
your right hand, you're screwed. Wait a
second. Your left arm and your right
hand. Your left arm and your right hand.
What do you mean by no gap? my left arm
and my right hand.
There must be a g like a gap in your
palm where your palm's in the club.
I don't know. Now I'm in the midst.
Not only did he say it's going to be a
bad shot, he said you're screwed.
Screwed.
That's a bold statement from Mr.
Dailyaly.
I don't know if it's the most important
thing. I I will say that John Daly is
more qualified to speak on that than me,
though.
I mean, he was probably like 15 Diet
Cokes deep when he said that, so who
knows where his mind was.
I have a closed face. That's a standard
grip. And you have me 22 yds left.
Let's look at a chart so you can see I'm
finishing left 3.66.
Word of caution before I go to the
midsize. This isn't as simple as just
having a fatter grip. It does affect the
club swing weight. Now, we'll do another
video on swing weight. But what do we
mean by swing weight?
Your balancing point is like 11 in in
something like that. Your swing weight
is going to be rated. That's when you
see like the C or D figures as most of
them. Most players are going to be in
like that low D. But it's going to be
the weight of the club head in
comparison to the rest of the club from
your hands down to where like Trevor's
finger is.
A bigger grip usually is heavier. So
it's going to put more weight in the
butt of the club and it will make the
club head feel lighter. Now swing weight
does affect performance.
Yeah.
So
some guys like just as simple as
putting putting that on and calling it
good. I personally get along better with
a lighter swing weight. So, putting a
heavier weight in the in the um
heavier grip
grip could be an added benefit for me as
well. I think it'll straighten me out a
little bit. Not significantly, but
I don't know if I that was placebo or
just a really good strike or what. How's
my undies?
I couldn't tell on that one. I wasn't
looking.
Well, see that one got away from They'll
still get away from me every now and
then, but I feel like not as bad.
That one sounded really good.
My ball, my contact is better, and I
think that's cuz the I can feel the club
weight being lighter. So, as an
unintended con consequence of the
midsize grip, it's helping with my swing
weight. I'm definitely striking it a
little bit better.
That's a toe ball. Bad toe ball, but
pretty online.
Oh, what the heck? That one got a little
healy. One more.
Yeah, definitely overall straighter.
That's an appropriate draw. Like that's
a draw you want to see on the course.
Yeah. Yeah. Much straighter.
Much better.
See that? Now it is an eight iron, so
that's why it's a little shorter.
But straight.
I don't care about distance right now.
That's all pretty consistent there.
1.24.
So better.
Oh yeah. Cut it in half.
Cut it in half. What was the yards
offline?
12.4.
Shaved 10 yards. 12.4 yards left. 1.24
closed. So he cut his face being closed
down by half, more than half. And his
yards by 10 yards left. So I mean 10
yards, that's a big difference. That
goes from being left edge of the green
to being in the cattails left of the
green.
Cattails.
Way to go. Yeah.
Way to go WWE. I mean say less.
Am I right?
Word of caution with the jumbo grip.
Yeah,
these are lightweight. So, they are
lighter, so they're not going to
intentionally like crazy affect your
swing weight,
which is cool.
So, it doesn't go crazy on the swing
weight cuz they make them purposely
light. There's not a crazy heavy jumbo
grip.
Yeah. The huge pro of that is you can
take your existing clubs and just do a
regrip. But let's say you take your
standard grip clubs and then you go to a
jumbo grip, maybe by Golf Pride or
Lambkin or Win. Now your whole swing,
the whole feel of your clubs is going to
be different. But now going to the Jumbo
Max, they have that engineered into it.
So you don't necessarily have to worry
as much about your clubs feeling totally
different other than your grip size.
Other word of caution, now this is
getting radical.
So the problem is, let's say you changed
to this and then you got used to this.
It's so formed. Like I don't know how
you're going to do a fitting if this is
what you're used to.
It's like a tennis racket, dude. Or if
you have to rent clubs, what do you do?
Like if you're standard or let's say
you're mid, you can get by playing some
standard clubs in a rental set or like
if you're used to this, like you better
have your clubs on you all the time.
Yeah. And you want to use a buddy set
and he's standard.
Oh boy.
It feels weird. Feel like this really
affects the swing. But we'll see.
I drew it, but that did not snap at all.
It's going to finish on the right side.
Oh no. I'm going to be so mad if I like
these grips cuz I do not want to change
to these.
I don't want you to change to those.
That just means I got to regrip all your
clubs.
Imagine this in a driver. Might be sweet
in a driver.
I think you need to leave your driver
the way that it is. You keep trying to
change the one club that's doing what
you need it to do.
Oh, that was a miss. But it's not going
left.
[Music]
It's back to back.
Open face.
Yep.
That one's shut, but I feel like with
the other one, it would have been gone.
That still controlled the
I felt it. I felt it go
offline. 17 yards.
Face was open.
I just I don't know what I did there.
Nobody does.
Kate, that's perfect.
I like these.
Dang it. I like them.
Look at that.
I mean, honestly, your biggest flaw
right now is your slingers. You kind of
have like a Rick Shield slinger on some
of your shots except he plays it. He
aims 20 yards right.
Dang it, Tate. Gosh dang it. Dang it. I
like them. But see, this is what I'm
nervous about. Like now
that feels like a twig.
I mean, I don't think I've ever seen you
rent a set of clubs.
If you're going on a trip, your clubs
are with you.
But I'm always trying new clubs here.
How am I going to do reviews? Look at
that, though.
Look at your ball flights. Even better.
How is that possible?
Yeah. And the dispersion's better. See
this?
Oh my goodness.
It's a nice tighter much tighter circle.
So, it was more consistent. It wasn't It
was a little more right, but not crazy.
It's coming in steeper, too. It's going
to hold greens better. Oh my goodness.
What are you doing, dude?
Yeah. Better spin.
You're crazy.
Just better ball striking, better
everything. Carried further, higher ball
flight
offline.
1.4 left. And then read me your
My face was more clos
1.82
open right.
Yeah.
That's crazy. So now we're down to 1.4
yards left. So he's still drawing the
ball obviously, but now he went from
1.24 closed to 1.82 open. Dude, I think
there's something going here. I mean,
you went from 22 yds left to 1.4 yards
left. You went 3.66° open or closed to
1.82 open.
I think it's real. I'm not a guy that
drinks the Kool-Aid often.
I think that's real.
Let me try the standard one again just
to see if we're seeing consistency here.
That for you is a bad strike though.
Yeah,
that's like a block right.
It just now this feels like an itty
bitty little guy.
Yeah, there. There she is. She came
home.
That felt pure.
Yeah,
that felt pure. Now, let's try this. Let
me try even try to go left.
I mean, you still can send it left if
you're really trying, but I was
purposely trying to.
I'm a fader of the golf ball. Do you
think it's going to be make have a worse
effect on me?
Probably
not closing it fast enough.
Probably.
That one was still open. So you drew it
with swing and this is massive.
Yeah, it's like too big.
It doesn't feel bad though. Like you the
whole It feels weird though. The whole
swing feels weird.
But you could get used to it. It's not
Oh, yeah.
Oh, you know what we did check is club
speed. Did it affect club speed?
We still can
on the chart. We just have to delete
like the last four. So 85 with the mid
85.7. No, standard was 84.
85
jumbo
87.
I got faster.
That's an eight iron.
So even though this one's a seven iron,
you're you went up in speed with the
bigger grip.
I'm striking the ball better for sure.
Your swing weight was probably less,
which means your your speed was probably
up a little bit.
Mhm.
That's crazy, though. Everything about
this one's the winner, I would say. Does
that mean that you're going to go out
and you're gonna spend,
you know, $13 a grip plus install fee?
So, let's say it's $20 a grip. If
somebody's doing5 or $6 a grip. So, if
somebody's doing, let's just say for
round numbers, $20 a grip. Let's say
you're going to do 13 clubs, everything
but the putter, 260 bucks to install new
grips.
Just on this data alone, does that seem
like it's worth it to spend $280 on an
experiment?
Alex, would you spend $260 on an
experiment?
I don't think so. But I want Trevor to
do it and go take him out on the course
and see what he shoots.
I'd like to see what Trevor does, too.
It doesn't take much to get Trevor to
switch. I think he does it. Alex, what
do you think? You think he does it?
I think he does it for sure. whether or
not he does it this week.
I think by tomorrow we'll go to the
build shop and either myself or one of
the guys will be over there changing
grips on his on his gamers.
And then how long till he's back to the
midsize grips?
One round in the '9s and he's they're
all done. He'll be cutting them off
himself. The data is in. You changing?
This is why I change so much is
sometimes I I have success in these
videos and then I'm like that's what I
need. This is a small sample size
though. So
it's usually the gear is what you're
thinking. It's always the gear. It's
never the player.
Yeah.
Ever.
