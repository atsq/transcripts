One of the biggest myths in the golf is
that you have to create space.
>> That's not a bad swing. Well, yeah, it
is. Wow. The swing gets so much more
easy to reproduce and understand. Once
you realize that
>> every golf school, there's at least one,
sometimes all four golfers are trying to
do this motion. It's a light bulb. It's
like, "Oh, that's way easier than what
I'm trying to do." One of the most
common questions we get, especially
after our pros versus ams video about
shallowing, and we we stopped that video
intentionally just to show you the
shallowing movement, which is basically
around lead arm parallel. This is what
that trail arm needs to do from there to
and through impact. And this creates a
lot of confusion just because of how we
see that thirderson view of the swing
from this camera. It certainly looks
like the hands are on the front leg with
shaffling. That's not what happens.
We're going to show you now exactly what
does happen. So, you've seen us probably
talk about this in recent videos about
how the hands are on the trail side of
the body. So, you want to kind of
demonstrate it that again, Sean. I like
how you go to impact and then square the
hips back up.
>> If I got into like a tour looking
impact, so hips are going to be 45
degrees open, which by the way is just
basically the belt buckle over the big
toe.
>> That's it.
>> We came up with that a while ago. Just
the easy way to think about it. All
right. Now, I'm going to do that first.
Now, I'm going to put my arms over top
of my body. Right. Shoulder line fairly
square to slightly open. Obviously, the
rib cage is open, but I'm side bend. So,
my shoulder line is still pretty square.
Right? And now, I have my arms where
they need to be. A little bit of shaft.
I'm going to take my
>> Just resquare your hips. Don't move
anything with your upper body. And just
resqu your hips.
>> From there's impact. So, his hands at
impact. We'll have you go back to that
again
from a face on camera have shaft or in
front of the ball, right? And depending
on the body dimensions, they're going to
be look like they're on the front leg.
Okay. Now, if you just square up to the
camera,
you can see that's an illusion. He did
not move his hands across his body to
put him on his front leg. He just turned
his body to the side to show the camera.
>> Yeah. Look, it's kind of crazy to think
about. Address impact.
>> Yes. The hands are farther back on your
body at impact than they are at address.
At address, they're usually on the front
leg.
>> Yeah. Address impact. More more
unccocked. Yep.
>> Right. Cuz the handle's higher at
impact. Still on the ground because I'm
touching the ground. Maybe off a little
cuz I'm pivoted back, but impact
basically right there, which is
mind-blowing because if you cut a line
right up the middle of my body, there
you go. The arms are on the trail side.
>> Okay, we're going to do this facing the
camera. So, there's still people kind of
scratching their head going, "How is
that possible?" All right, I'm going to
put you at a 45Â° angle to that camera.
So, you line up with your toes on this
shaft and do the exact same thing you
did there. So, this this face on camera
is going to be able to see what we're
talking about. Yeah. You're doing that
to show that the turning motion hides
it.
>> Yeah. Cuz the camera now is going to be
>> instead of being squared up to the hips
at address, it's going to be squared up
to his hips at impact.
>> So there's 45. Now I'm facing this
camera straight out of my belt line.
Right.
>> And then if I drop my arms back, now you
get a better view.
>> So the hands and you can see images and
we'll put some on the screen of pros at
impact with this same look. The hands
are on the trail side of the body. We
got that covered.
>> So that's the first thing you got to
understand. We're not trying to wipe the
hands across the body to produce
shaftling. That's not how any good
player you've ever seen, certainly on
TV, do that.
>> Not a fan of saying wipe in a golf.
>> It's not a good It's not a good one.
Good term. Okay.
>> It's like shame.
>> So how do we get then from this where
that pros versus video ended to that
spot and then be on that spot.
>> So where the pros versus video right
here basically. that basically right
around left arm parallel.
>> Hips are square. Trail elbow is
basically reconnected to the side.
Tricep reconnect to the side. So
>> let's let's stick on that.
>> Yeah.
>> Do show that again.
>> I'll get out
>> on the tricep. So your bicep or upper
arm is basically on the same angle as
your body line. It is not
>> in front or the elbow is not working
towards the navl.
>> Well, it's interesting. There's a place
for it where the club will pitch about
right. I never thought about it like
that. But if I go too far back, it tends
to pitch too vertical. Right? If I go to
the top and pitch my arm this way, if I
drive too much, so there's a pretty
there's a there's a spot right there
that makes this fairly simple just to
get this club to shadow the right
amount.
>> And if you want to see that, the easiest
way to see that is just stand up. So
this would be address and my arm is
about a 45 degree angle to my spine at
the point Sean showed. The arm's right
there. So it's just in line. Now I'm
bent over. That's it.
>> So it looks like that. If I get my elbow
in front, it's actually lifted in the
down swing for me to get in this
position.
>> It puts the hands out too much over the
ball.
>> No good player does that. Okay. So,
we're coming down. We're reconnected to
the rib cage.
The elbow, if we put a a gears marker on
the outside of the elbow and outside of
the hip, the outside of the elbow is
always behind the hip coming into
impact.
>> Okay. Now, what?
>> So, now you're going to keep So, let's
see. The best way to show this would be
Yeah. this down the line view.
>> So, I'm going to
get to square and then stop the body and
show what the arm would do.
>> Okay, perfect.
>> Okay, so at the top, I've come halfway
down. Now, if I had a a machine where I
could just stop my body or software and
then show what the arm would do from
here,
>> it's going to unccock and lower some
more. I'm going to unfold my elbow some.
And then it's going to actually go that
way. This is the tricky part of the
release. So now I'm going to put that
dot do go back to the starting point
there.
>> My dot right maybe last can put a dot
right there on your elbow. Watch. It's
going to go out closer to the ball and
over
>> kind of like a 45 I would say right
there.
>> Now cool part is if I continue my pivot
around that's what gets in the classic
kind of shake hands with a target
release position or even more depending
on how much rotation you have. It's not
about taking the hand path left by using
this wipe motion. The arms, this
adduction motion across the chest. That
happens later. But if you want to get a
pure release, the arm has to feel this
way. And you can see if I just add the
pivot, it puts you in a worldass release
position.
>> Yeah. So, we'll do that squared up to
the camera now. So, it's right here is
kind of the delivery phase of my hips
aren't open. And what you're talking
about is the hands work this way. They
work in front
this way, not in front towards the
target.
>> They don't pass the midline.
>> They go right to the midline. And then
again, you're going to see them start to
pass the midline as the hands and club
start to go over the head. But impact
delivery is here. There. Now watch. You
can't see the outside of my elbow,
>> but I finger. So my finger starts there.
Now go
>> to there. It always goes out more. Uh I
think the average is from shaft parallel
to shaft parallel. I think the average
is 8 in out and around towards the golf
ball. Myth. One of the biggest myths in
the golf is that you have to create
space. You do not create space because
the arm stays beside the body. I'm just
turning my body as that happens.
>> The swing is we say this all the time.
It is an illusion.
>> It's a well because that camera does not
move.
>> Yeah. The turning motion skews
everything that's happening.
>> Yes.
>> Like if I go like this, you'd be like,
"That's not a back swing." Well, yeah,
it is. What is the back swing?
>> Cuz if I do this and turn,
>> right?
>> It It's mindbending at first, but wow,
the swing gets so much more easy to
reproduce and understand. Once you
realize that when you break these
movements out, you can train them a
little bit more individually. Like you
could stand here and say, "Oh, I got to
do that with my arm." You could just
keep your body square almost like like a
circular motion. I know Haney Hank Haney
had this drill where he would get guys
kind of making circles. He would get him
making circles on the right side like
this and then kind of swing to fix
slices. That's what he was doing. He was
training in that motion where the arm
goes that way. This is
>> because so many of us struggle with
impact, right? You're watching this
video. You probably struggle with
impact. Think about how easy this motion
is.
Top spin forehand
>> compared to this motion.
>> Low slice over the net.
>> This is why every golf school there's at
least one, sometimes all four golfers
are trying to do this motion.
>> That's the wipe
>> because it looks like that's what
happens from a static camera angle. But
you know, with AMG 3D, we can put the
gears, every millimeter, every joint
moves. So, we can put that in AMG3D
and turn off any segment. And when you
can turn off the turn, like you said,
and you see, okay, this is how the arm
moves with no turn, it's a light bulb.
It's like, oh, that's way easier than
what I'm trying to do.
>> Yeah. If you just This is kind of
interesting. If you just thought, that
you knew where the club needed to get
right here.
>> Yep. Yeah. So, I'll I'll hold the club
here.
>> Like, so I know I got to get there. What
the average golfer would do is try to
put their hands there like that because
they, oh, I got there, but they don't
realize that the hands kind of stay over
here and go like this
>> and then my turn is what gets them
there.
>> So, let's do that from this angle. Now,
>> by the way, I've never thought about
like this.
>> Let's do that from this angle. You're
making my brain light up a little
dimmer. So, don't allow your hands to
cross your midline and do this.
>> Okay. So, so come back to square.
>> Yep.
>> So, there's my square.
>> Yep. So, where would your hands be in
the down swing? You'd be on your trail
side.
>> They are.
>> Don't let them cross the midline and
touch the grip.
>> There you go.
>> They're still there. That That's the
feeling to get. It goes back to the
fishing for positions,
>> right?
>> If you're just trying to stick the club
there, oh, I'm putting my club in the
release, but you didn't realize that the
only reason it goes there is cuz your
arms are going like this. You're going
to be lost. That's why a lot of people
play golf their whole life and never get
any better. There's there's golfers at
golf courses that never ever ever get
better just because of lack of good
information.
>> I played nine holes yesterday after
work.
>> Oh, you snuck some golf in.
>> Yeah, I'm trying to trying to get it
right. And u I got paired with two
gentlemen, great guys, senior golfers,
right? Both retired. And one guy, bless
could not stop making the ball go at a
45 degree angle to the right.
>> He was a new golfer just learning. His
buddy was trying to help him. He had the
same problem. But no one wanted to
shank. It was just a massively open face
because he got here and was trying to
make it go straight as best he could. I
showed him exactly the haney deal.
>> Yeah. Just make the circle.
>> And started making that circle. He goes,
"There's no way that's right. Just try
it."
>> Well, sir, I do.
>> The first couple times, right, the face
was like this wide open and then like,
"No, you got to let that go. You got to
let that go." And then he started to
actually make the ball turn over
>> and was flabbergasted that that's what
it took.
>> It's just our perception from seeing
swings from these, you know, angles that
aren't what the body's doing and then
try to backineer it, you're going to
wind up some really goofy ideas.
>> For a long time, probably video and stop
motion video is probably hurt golfers
more than it's helping because they're
able to stop positionally.
All all of the bad swing concepts that
I'm aware of come from video.
>> Yeah. And the the 3D is like been the
best thing for my whole life game in
general because we can break out the
movements.
>> So that's how you get from the shallow
spot to impact and it's just by keeping
your arm on the trail side of your body
moving to the midline, not across it.
The cross happens way up in here. So if

this, go to the first pin comment down

to show you another drill other than the
awareness drill to how show you how to
start to incorporate this proper trail
arm movement in your down swing.
