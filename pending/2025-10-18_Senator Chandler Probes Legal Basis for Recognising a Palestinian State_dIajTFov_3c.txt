What are the qualifications for
recognition of a state at international
law?
>> Recognition of a a state is primarily a
a political uh decision.
>> At international law, it's a political
decision to recognize a state. There
must be some sort of legal definition
that we use to determine whether
something is a state. There are some uh
I guess traditional criteria that are uh
that are are relevant but the ultimate
decision of whether to to recognize is a
political one.
>> What are what are the traditional
criteria?
>> Uh they are a a permanent population, a
defined territory, a government and the
capacity to enter into relations with
other states.
>> So my understanding is those are the
criteria set out under the Monte Vido
Convention. Is that correct?
>> Correct.
>> So they're not traditional criteria.
They're something that's set out under a
convention.
>> But a decision whether to recognize is a
political decision.
>> Does Palestine have agreed borders which
define its territories?
>> I think the um I can't give legal advice
on the application of those criteria to
the the committee. I think I would point
the the committee.
>> Sorry. It's a physical question, not a
legal question. Does Palestine have
agreed borders which define its
territory?
>> I I would refer that to to DEFAT.
>> Really?
>> Yes.
>> Yes.
>> Does Palestine have a single government
in effective control of its territory?
>> Senator, I think this is in fact legal
advice because it's the application of
uh uh criteria. So it would be giving
you advice on legal considerations.
>> I think these questions are in relation
to factual matters though not not legal
advice that you may or may not have
provid provided the government. The
question is does Palestine have agreed
borders and do they have a single
government? I would have thought that
was a pretty straightforward factual yes
or no answer. So senator our involvement
is uh with the office of international
law as international legal advisers on
Michigan's directed you to the
department of foreign affairs and trade.
Okay.
Did the office of international law give
advice to the government on whether
Australia's recognition of a Palestinian
state was legitimate?
>> We have given advice to government on
the issue of recognition. When was that
advice provided? Miss Shane,
>> we'd need to take that on notice, I
think, because
>> Yeah, I think we might need to take on
notice the the precise uh dates, there
would have been probably multiple
occasions on which we provided advice.
>> Multiple multiple occasions on which you
provided advice.
>> Yes. O
>> over the scope of many years. Um
>> many years. How many years, Miss Jones?
Um I I I think in my time in the
department this issue has come up uh
numerous times probably over the last 15
years.
>> Over the last 15 years
>> but I look that's actually I should be
careful. Uh I wouldn't be precise but
it's it's come up multiple times.
>> Okay. Well I think it would be useful
for the committee to at least know how
many times um you've had to provide
advice on this matter since the Labor
government have been in power. Um, and
I'd hope that it would be relatively
straightforward for some official here
to provide that information to the
committee before the end of um, this
section of the program today.
Um, so when it became time for the
government to make this specific
recognition and this specific change in
relation to um, recognition of
Palestine,
could you at least provide me with the
date on which the Office of
International Law gave advice to the
government recently?
>> We'll take that on notice.
>> Okay.
What's the capital of Palestine,
>> Senator? We can't comment on on that
>> because you don't know or because you
legally unsure.
>> Well, I think it's not a matter for this
department. Senator,
do
>> you know what the capital of Israel is?
Um, Senator, I don't think that's a
matter within the attorney general's
responsibilities.
>> Was the Office of International Law
asked for advice on any of these
questions that I have asked you today?
>> Um, we've agreed to take on notice the
dates of advice we've given.
>> Was the Office of International Law ever
asked to provide advice on whether a
state can be recognized on a conditional
basis?
Senator, I think that's starting to get
into the content of advice uh that we
wouldn't comment on.
>> Okay. Generally speaking, can
recognition of a state ever be
conditional?
>> Senator, that would constitute legal
advice.
>> Um
I'm trying to figure out if I can phrase
that in a way where it wouldn't
constitute legal advice. I mean going
back to um
the evidence that you provided that
apparently um
recognition of a state is a political
question but there is a legal framework
under the Monte Vado convention that we
utilize to make that determination.
Does the Monte Vido convention allow for
conditional recognition of a state?
I think that would be providing legal
advice to the the committee.
>> Okay.
On the 11th of August, when the prime
minister announced that Australia would
recognize Palestine, he outlined a
series of commitments which Australia
had obtained in the course of the
government's decision to recognize
Palestine. And the prime minister said,
"Our government has made it clear that
there can be no role for the terrorists
of Hamas in any future Palestinian
state. This is one of the commitments
Australia has sought and received from
President Abbas and the Palestinian
Authority. The PA has reaffirmed it
recognizes Israel's right to exist in
peace and security. It's committed to
demilitarize and to hold general
elections. It has pledged to abolish the
system of payments to the families of
prisoners and martyrs and promise
broader reform of governance, financial
transparency in the education system,
including international oversight to
guard against the incitement of violence
and hatred. These detailed and
significant commitments have been given
even greater weight by the Arab League's
unprecedented demand for Hamas to end
its rule in Gaza and surrender its
weapons to the Palestinian authorities.
But those commitments have no bearing on
whether Palestine is recognized as a
state legally. Would that be correct?
I think the the government's decision
was to to recognize the the state of of
Palestine and it's it's now uh done so.
>> Yes. Um but the prime minister outlined
a series of conditions that he um or
commitments that he had sought and
seemingly obtained.
But the reality is when it comes to that
legal recognition, there's no way of
guaranteeing that those commitments
would be seen through.
>> I think what the my understanding of
what the the prime minister was setting
out was what considerations the
government was taking into account in
its decision which is now taken to
recognize.
But when we're trying to
when the government is going through the
process of recognizing that state, I
mean that's those commitments are all
sort of future-looking things. There's
no legal way of guaranteeing that those
things
have to occur before recognition can
take place. Is that correct?
I think I uh would repeat my earlier
answer that there were you know
political considerations and it's
ultimately a political decision to uh to
decide to recognize.
>> The prime minister obviously said in
that quote that I just read out that
Hamas can play no role in the future of
a Palestinian state. If in due course
Palestine holds elections and Hamas is
elected, can we revoke recognition of
Palestinian statethood
>> legally?
>> I think that would amount to providing
legal advice to the committee.
>> You you can't tell us
whether or not Australia would be
recognizing a terrorist state if Hamas
is elected the government of Palestine.
Senator, there's there's um a number of
hypotheticals there and we would not
generally respond to hypotheticals uh
here at Estimates. Can the department
confirm that the recognition of
Palestine as a state is a legal question
that is not tied to the conflict between
Israel and Hamas?
>> Senator, I think Nashen has said a
couple of times that it's ultimately a
political decision that the government
has taken. Um, I'm not sure we can
provide any further commentary.
>> Can the department confirm that
recognition of Palestine as a state is a
legal question that doesn't prevent
violence, doesn't get aid through, and
doesn't release hostages?
>> Well, I think just have to reiterate the
point that um, Migi and Mich have made
that ultimately it is a political
decision.
Fair to say that's a pretty frustrating
series of responses um from the
officials today. I mean, Minister, the
truth is that this decision to recognize
Palestine wasn't about achieving peace
in the Middle East. It um wasn't about
the situation on the ground. It was
around frankly satisfying your party's
membership base which I know feel very
strongly about this is issue. Isn't that
right?
Um I would completely disagree with you
um senator. Um and I think it was about
peace and trying to bring a peaceful
resolution
to the uh to the Middle East. um
for the whole of my life there's been
conflict in the Middle East and um
um the events of two years ago tomorrow
of course uh were just uh another
terrible indication of uh what's been
happening uh in that region for far too
long. um a group of company countries
including the United Kingdom, France,
Canada um so people you know countries
that we often u identify with
internationally
um made similar decisions that um one
way to progress the issue of peace in
the Middle East particularly in these
most difficult of circumstances was to
provide recognition to um the
Palestinians.
Um and that decision, as you've been
questioning the officials,
uh was uh was made earlier this year. Um
I know it would be disappointing from
the coalition's point of view if peace
did occur in the Middle East because
you'd then have nothing to uh to
>> Well, no, no, no, no. You with respect,
with respect, Senator with respect.
>> Yeah. Well, with respect, I was
answering the question and you made
allegations that this whole issue is
about domestic Australian internal Labor
Party politics. This is not about any of
those things. This is about trying to
provide a peaceful settlement which um
certainly this government wants to see
in the Middle East. Nobody nobody wants
to see the fighting continue.
>> Of course,
>> um nobody more than the Labour party
would like to see an end to the conflict
in that region and that includes the
prime minister and the uh and the
foreign minister. So to the extent that
as a government we can influence
international events
uh then we want to put uh stake our
claim to a peaceful resolution uh of
this issue and uh if as reports are
already suggesting that there may be a
peace deal in the next few days um
nothing would give the Labor party
nothing would give the prime minister
nothing would give me greater
satisfaction action to know that
something that an Australian government
had done had contribute had contributed
to the peaceful outcome in the Middle
East.
>> Minister,
>> well, well, I know I would I would say
the same thing about the Greens. Once
once there's peace in the Middle East,
once once once once once peace is
achieved in the Middle East, of course
you have nothing further to contribute
to this b debate. Both the Greens and
the Coalition are in the same position.
Um the Labor Party wants to see a
peaceful resolution. wants the Labor
Party wants to see a The Labor Party The
Labor Party wants to see the the Labor
Party wants to see a peaceful
resolution.
>> Senators, can I just give us give us a
bit of a resolution to the issue?
>> Sorry, Minister, can I get you to pause
for a second? Senators, can we just take
a breath? I want to allow Senator
Chandler to finish her final couple of
questions, and I will encourage senators
not to interject, please. Senator
Chandler,
>> thank you very much, Chair.
The the problem I have with what what we
discussed here this afternoon is that
the evidence of the department was that
it was a political decision to recognize
Palestinian statethood, but then a
series of questions around
what
may and what conditions may or may not
have to have been satisfied to agree on
statehood. ood were effectively legal
advice. So I'm just trying to understand
how much
how how the decision to recognize
statehood was made in terms of whether
the government sought advice from you to
say legally can we do this and you said
legally yes we can or you said legally
yes we can't or you said legally things
have changed at this point in time. But
I I don't think we can say that it's a
purely political decision and then for
the department to say but we provide
legal advice on that because you know
you can't have both in an effect.
>> So I think that that is consistent
senator in the sense that it is
ultimately a decision for for
government. um we've taken on notice
to indicate the dates on which we've
given advice but um there are some
indicia that ultimately it is a matter
for government to to make that decision.
>> Minister,
can you answer my questions about
Palestine having agreed borders which
define its territory or Palestine having
a single government in effective control
of its territory?
Um, I can answer what I know about um
the the Middle East, but I I think it
would be more appropriate if you've got
questions um of that nature that uh we
either refer it to the um
uh the attorney general herself or for
that matter to the minister for Foreign
Affairs.
>> Okay.
