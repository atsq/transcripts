He's mad about me. Oh, sorry. Hassan is
mad about me. What is this?
>> It's pretty wild for him to say that. I
mean, it's a wild position for him in
particular to say considering, you know,
>> what is he saying?
>> The org that he was a part of and how
much how how many people had to leave
the organization.
>> Do you know why they had to leave?
It's because I was one of the people
that made that decision.
And at the time that I had to decide
whether I was going to support something
like that or not,
I made the best decision possible,
at least at the time.
That's why a lot of them aren't part of
it anymore.
I think this argument defeats itself.
But I guess they're American citizens,
so it's appropriate. There's no reason
why any
who got convicted of rape.
Oh, that's right. Nobody.
Oh, right. Okay. So, this is a
comparison with something that didn't
happen. Okay.
Anybody should be supporting that. I I
think yeah that
>> like guy's biggest dick rider is uh
guy's biggest dick rider and only
remaining bestie is rapet tone
who
I can understand why tee and hassan
don't like each other. They tweet about
each other a lot. They say a lot of
negative stuff about each other. Hassan
has said a lot of bad stuff about Tee.
Tectton said a lot of bad stuff about
Hassan. Here's the difference. The
things that Hassan is criticizing Tee
for are in a twit longer and the things
that Tech is criticizing Hassan for are
on camera.
Is seemingly a generational rapist. Like
not even not
>> That's right. Because Teone's dad had
some sort of like weird [ __ ] thing
happen. By the way, what the [ __ ] does
his dad have to do with any of this?
Like, I I I don't even understand the
logic here. Why are we even talking
about Tee's dad?
It's weird.
Generational, literal, original sin.
Yeah. like like Tactone was was it's
what a weird thing to say.
>> Has he been credibly accused
by former part?
>> Well, I didn't say credibly accused. I
said convicted.
Has he been convicted? Has he even gone
to trial? The answer to both of those
questions or no, which is one of the
reasons why I don't know why. See, this
is this is what I find to be funny is
that and I I get that Techone and Hassan
are way more aggro at each other than I
am, right? I'm not really very I I'm I
I'm critical of Hassan, but I'm not like
as aggro as as he is with Tecton, but
the difference is that
you probably shouldn't have been calling
him a rapist before he got convicted to
be a rapist. Unless you have some sec
some sort of like you know insider
information that nobody else knows about
that proves it and in which case please
provide that to the authorities so
appropriate action can be taken but I
don't think that you do. So whenever
you're reading something like this and
you automatically make a decision and
you're telling your viewers you have a
lot of viewers. Okay he does he does a
lot of people watch this on. You should
not be telling all these people that a
person who was accused of this
is a rapist. You shouldn't be doing
this. It's a mistake. I don't know why
you do this. Now, I I don't want to get
involved because I know Teone has said a
lot of bad stuff about Hassan.
I get it. But all I'm saying is that I
think it's pretty unfair if you look at
it from my perspective
that all of these allegations and
everything, you're trying to compare
them with a conviction.
It's just not the same thing.
That's it. That That's all there is to
it. It's literally just not the same
thing.
partners, but also his dad apparently
was such a prolific sexual assaulter
that his sexual Why the [ __ ] are you
talking about his dad?
What What does this have to do with
anything
really? Like what is this? Like why are
we even talking about his dad?
>> Assaults were codified in the American
Congress. Yes. In the American
Congressional Records.
>> Like,
>> what is this? What does Te's dad have to
do with this?
>> I I don't get this at all.
Crazy. And that's I mean, what should be
done in that situation?
I am not an advocate
for capital punishment.
It's just wild to me that like he has
this kind of attitude here for some
reason,
>> but he doesn't have the same energy for
uh people that he knows
because they weren't convicted and you
shouldn't be calling them as if they did
the things that they're being accused
of.
You're Yeah. I And I think he's really
like I mean this is the thing. I mean
this is honest advice to Hassan.
The fact is, and this is the case with
me too,
we are getting into a position where he
and I are both very, very successful in
our careers. He is very successful and I
think that I am too.
That is also a problem because people
will see people like us say something
and they will try to dissect it and
figure out a way that they can sue us.
Hassan needs to watch out by saying this
random stuff and going off and coming up
with these names about people and saying
this stuff because eventually you're
going to run yourself into a defamation
lawsuit. And it doesn't matter how many
Twitter orbiters you have and how many
people you ban and chat. Whenever you're
sitting there in the courtroom being
accused of defamation or lying about
somebody, it's not going to matter
whether there's a genocide going on.
It's not going to matter whether uh you
know what his dad did. It's not going to
matter any of these other [ __ ]
accusations.
What's going to matter really is it is
Zionist is is oh this person took money
from Israel or something. It it's it's
ridiculous. And and he you're going to
like and I think really he should look
at like really I mean you know he will
not admit this publicly but take a step
back and think about it. you know, do
you think that you handled the dog
collar thing very well? I think the
answer to that probably is no. You you
really didn't. And I think that the way
that you've drugged it on, you've
dragged it on and everything else,
you've brought other people into it as
well, uh, this has not helped you. And
and it it's it's been bad. And I I think
that one of the reasons why is because
it seems very clear to me that Hassan is
unable to accept any degree of fault,
ill behavior, mistake, even a very small
one. And I think that what that's going
to do in a long enough timeline is it's
going to get him into a lot of trouble.
Right now, it's just some [ __ ]
internet drama. He shocked his dog
memes. The memes are funny. He knows
they're funny. Everybody knows they're
funny.
If you keep doing this and saying this
stuff about people, eventually you're
going to run into a problem legally. I
think it's obvious and he should know
that.
I don't know why he's doing this.
He's setting himself up to fail for no
reason.
And it will happen. It will eventually
happen for sure.
given a long enough timeline.
You've got to stop making [ __ ] up about
people.
His platform is too big. There's too
many people that watch him. You live in
a multi-million dollar house.
You've got a big target on your back,
man. And I'm not talking about weirdos
trying to like attack you. Nobody
supports that. It's disgusting. I ban
people in my chat for even implying
that. But what I am saying is that there
is a monetary legal target on your back
and you need to watch out for that.
You're setting yourself up to fail for
no reason.
There's no reason you need to do this.
I I don't know why he does this.
I I I I I really don't.
Why do you care about him so much? I
mean, I'm not caring about him. I'm I I
just I I'm I'm listening to it. I I hear
I I hear what he's saying. Like we have
a lot of mutual friends.
And also like the thing is that there's
a number of things with Hassan that I
agree with Assan on like with a lot of
economic things I agree with him on.
It's disappointing to see these like
weird partisan wedge issues effectively
turn people that have in a lot of cases
symbiotic goals into enemies. It didn't
have to be like this. It doesn't have to
be like this. There's no reason for it
to be like this.
It's unnecessary. It's counterproductive
and it's destructive and eventually it
will destroy him.
And I think that's a sad thing.
It is. That's where I'm at. I don't I
don't have any I don't have anything
negative to say about him personally. I
mean, I I will say this about Hassan,
right? I do not think that Hassan is a
horrible person. Dog thing is separate.
I don't think that he is. The reason why
Hassan has been making content for 10
years, over 10 years,
there have never been a lot of really,
really bad controversies about him.
There have never been a lot of really
bad leaks about bad things that he's
done.
Most of the bad things that he's done,
he's done on camera.
And I'm coming at this from the
perspective of a content creator. And I
think that a lot of content creators
over time will eventually get exposed.
They will eventually have somebody say
that this person said this thing that
was bad behind closed doors. Hassan has
been in the space for about as long as I
have. You know, give or take.
And in the same way that I say look at
me, look at the amount of bad
interactions that I've had with other
people, other tweers that people have
had, etc.
on a personal level. I'm not talking
about his viewpoints and his politics.
I'm talking about on a personal level
how he interacts with other people. I
don't think that Hassan is a bad person.
I do not think that.
I just wish he wouldn't act this way.
It's unnecessary. It doesn't have it
does not have to be like this.
That's my viewpoint. I know that you
guys might not see it the way that I do,
but my perspective on this is probably a
little bit different because the way
that I see it is through the lens of a
content creator. And so I'm contrasting
this with other content creators.
Does that make sense? Mov streams
audience boy off audience be [ __ ] We
all know it. Sure. Right. But I'm just
saying like in terms of personal like
interpersonal problems,
that's something that I that that's
something that I have a very very
one thing that I've learned is that
people that have problems everywhere
they go,
I wonder why.
So yeah,
all I'm saying is that I don't need to
criticize a person's opinions and then
turn that into a personal attack.
There's no need for me to do that. It's
unnecessary.
Um it's destructive. It's it it's not
productive. And I think it's off
message. I try to stay on message as
much as I can. I think that I make
mistakes. Everybody does. But um you're
going to keep making mistakes until you
uh realize it. So that's it.
You will use this to twist your words.
He he can say whatever he wants. It
doesn't matter. Like it it's it's still
that's still what I think.
He's bought innocent people many times
is different. Well, I'm talking about
like and I I just I don't know. Like I I
think people just get on the internet
and they just say things. They get
gassed up by their [ __ ] audience and
they just say stupid stuff. Like I
understand that people might not like
that answer. And it does I'm not I'm not
handwaving it and saying it's okay, but
I'm not taking it seriously because I
think that's the way that people do. I
think Frogan is like that. For example,
I don't think Froggen is a horrible
person. I just think that she gets in
her [ __ ] room sitting there getting
gassed up by her 60 or 50 or 100 viewers
and it just turns people into the worst
versions of themselves.
That's what I think. I I I genuinely
believe that.
I think that most people can generally
get along.
And whenever you sit inside of an echo
chamber of people that tell you that
you're right about everything, and you
never listen to anybody else's
perspective, all of your friends are
exactly the same, everybody says the
same things that you do, I I I think
that is a radicalizing force and it
makes people more extreme, but that's
not a default. And I think that you can
move people away from that default very
quickly.
What's the next clip? Is Is there
another one? I don't know if there's
another one.
come out against me. Oh my god. Is it
another one against me?
This is the same thing that I I can
guarantee you already. This is
absolutely every single thing that he's
going to say about me, people are also
going to say about him. And you know
what? They're all right. They're right
when they say it about me, and they're
right when they say it about you.
Let's listen and find out.
Zach is always copying your language,
always using the words in the wrong
places, but it won't matter until
someone like a big streamer said, "Take
one minute to go and undermine the
streamer right now." And 10x more people
would nip it in the bud than the few
starting it. Every smear has a potential
to slow down or stagger progression.
What do you mean?
Yeah. No big streamer is ever going to
come out and be like, "Aminold is
ridiculous for saying these sorts of
things." I'm gonna I
>> I don't know. I mean, people have
criticized plenty of things that I've
said.
I'm going to tell you exactly why they
won't.
>> This is going to be the exact reason why
people won't criticize him, by the way.
You ready?
>> I think you already know. Because every
[ __ ] big streamer who actually
opposes his world view are utterly
[ __ ] terrified of his audience. Okay,
that's it. They're 100% terrified of his
audience because his fan base does not
have any [ __ ] They don't have any any
um restraint. They real
>> you didn't have to do this to yourself.
>> Um so I'm on break at work right now, so
I look kind of chopped, but um Hassan
[ __ ] fans are actually raid animals. My
DMs are full of people threatening to
>> You didn't have to do this. Why would
you do this to yourself?
>> Calling me Amber Herd as an insult,
saying that I am um propaganda and I'm
being paid by YouTubers that I also
hate. Yeah, it's crazy that I called out
Hassan for
>> and she's obviously talking about me, by
the way.
She's obviously talking about probably
me and Ethan and maybe also Baldi.
>> Tourism and misogyny and being basically
a passport bro. And I've got people
calling me like
a conservative in my DMs and just saying
I'm spreading propaganda and that even
if he did these things, we still need
him as the face of the left. But yeah,
Hassan fans straight up got me
demonetized. And this is coming from
someone that used to be subbed to
Hassan. I was giving that millionaire
money because I was an idiot. So, um,
yeah, maybe let's cool it with the rape
threats because I don't really think
that's helping with the misogyny
allegations. Um, that would be great if
you could stop threatening to murder me.
>> And for the most part, Hassan is not
necessarily responsible for what his
audience does unless he's telling them
to do this. This is just a this is an
outcome of having a a community built
around talking about extremely volatile,
extremely serious issues.
And and the reason why I don't want to
blame Assan is because I don't want
people to blame me because anything you
can say about him, you can say about me,
too. This is the thing is that he's
right about this, but he's the he this
is the pot calling the kettle black.
This is the same thing
because his fan base does not have any
[ __ ] they don't have any any um
restraint. They've realized that they
can just like go after anyone and
everyone and uh name them, shame them,
smear them, take clips out of context,
uh constantly yell.
>> Uh an example of this not happening, by
the way, recently was with Rey.
Uh I was not rude to her at all. I'm
sure that there were people in my
audience that were rude, and I find that
to be disappointing. And if I find out
that they were doing that in a way that
was
ungentlemanly, you might end up getting
perma banned because it's just it's not
something that I want to see people do.
But um I I think that's a good example
right off the bat. Like I mean that was
literally a few days ago. I don't take
it personally at all
in their in their chats. go to all the
other go to every other chat and and
demand that the other streamers talk
about this uh this this new victim in
the crosshairs,
you know. So that is the reason
>> I did
>> that is the reason why no one will
actually come out and oppose any of his
viewpoints even if they quietly oppose
it.
>> That's the same thing with him.
And it's not just Asmin Gold to be fair.
It's not just Asmin Gold at all. There
are plenty of other like there's a bunch
of kick streamers that do the same [ __ ]
too. It just doesn't really matter. And
I mean, look, I'm one of the very few
people out there who does actually
oppose a lot of streamers when they do
[ __ ] [ __ ]
>> And that's good. I think that's totally
fine. I don't have a single problem with
Assan giving his take and giving his
opinion and disagreeing with what I'm
saying or what anybody else is saying. I
think that's his right and I think
that's a good thing and it's important
to have people that disagree with you in
spaces so that way it keeps you sharp as
well.
I don't have a problem with people
disagreeing with me at all.
and
and look how look how much
I eat it on a daily [ __ ] basis.
>> I am one of the only people that has not
gone out and like hyper condemned Hassan
for the the [ __ ] dog thing. I haven't
I and if you go back through all the
VODs and everything, I have never gone
out and like gone and been like, "Oh,
he's such a horrible person. I can't
believe he's done this. He's using his
friends." I never have done that. Now,
I've laughed at the jokes and I've
covered the controversy, but I've never
really condemned him. And the reason why
is because I don't really know what's
going on. I'm not 100% sure and I don't
want to do that.
Trace, the opposite. No, it's it's okay.
It's not a big deal. But I I do farm
people. I do I do absolutely do that.
And I'm sure he might be a little bit
upset about the dog stuff. And listen,
if he can go back to what I said, and I
even predicted what was going to happen
to him before he went live the first day
of this controversy. I said that it
would not matter what he did and what he
said, people would have already made up
their mind that he was guilty.
And I was right.
It I mean, it sure seems like there's
some other clips that that look kind of
bad, right? But at the same time, people
already made up their mind. They did.
They had already made up their mind. It
didn't matter what what he had shown on
that stream. It would have it would have
still been something else.
So yeah, and uh he's guilty. I mean,
some of the clips do definitely look bad
now, right? But at the time, I didn't
know that and nobody knew that. So just
so he's made up his mind about Tetown
allegations. I mean I
Yeah, I mean I I obviously know more
about it, right? Is about disagreeing
with animal abuse. Is he trying to
dissuade people to make up other [ __ ]
What about the genocide? I I don't know
about that.
So yeah, and the fake care about the dog
is so force people act like you beat the
dog and shots used regularly for dog
training. I I I think that I think that
what people really don't like I mean I
don't know like I mean it's I I I don't
want to get into like all the I I I'm
not a big moralizer.
I'm not I'm not a big moralizer. It's
It's not the
It It's not I I I I just I'm just not
sorry. I'm just I'm not I'm not a big
guy like that. Now, if you want to do
that, that's totally fine, but it's just
not my it it that's not that's not my
personality.
Somebody uh Mag being deleted. I don't
know if it's people attacking you or
talking about either way mods. Well,
it's it's not that big of a deal, right?
Do you think it would have been better
if he just admitted shocking a dog and
say meant to press the vibrate, not the
shock? Uh I I don't know. I mean like I
I think you should I mean I I don't know
what happened. So it's impossible to
know.
So it's it's YouTube comments. Oh yeah.
Yeah. A lot of people are spamming about
YouTube, etc. But uh yeah, that's at
least the way I feel about it.
Chess being a little bit stupid about
not seeing your point as a content
creator. That's okay. I mean, it's a
unique perspective that I think that
only I and a few of other people would
have. Uh I I can't all I can do is
express how I think. I can't tell other
people what to think.
So that that's it. That's all I can do.
And so like I I don't really try to
worry about it or get upset about it or
fight about it or anything like that.
It's just really not a big deal.
Rea was on big streamers are afraid of
your audience. Oh yeah. Yeah. I I just
got done watching it. I think it's
partially true. I think that obviously a
lot of people don't want to come out and
say negative things about me because a
lot of people in my audience will be
mean to them. And I think that also a
lot of people view disagreement as
harassment. Like for example, whenever I
disagree with a person and somebody else
disagrees with you, that's not
necessarily harassment. somebody telling
you that you're wrong or you don't know
what you're talking about. This isn't
really harassment. Uh it's just simply
people talking about stuff for whatever
reason. That's it.
You'd be okay for not wanting to
moralize or high ground over things even
on No. Well, no. I mean, I I it's not
that I don't like moralizing over things
in general. And the reason why is that I
think that I do have a very strong moral
compass. It just doesn't necessarily
point north. Maybe northeast, maybe
northwest, maybe even west, maybe even
east, but it definitely doesn't port
point directly north. Like my my uh
perspective on these things, it's a
little bit a little bit off, right? And
I I'm I'm Yeah, not not south. I didn't
say south. Okay. But uh not all the
time. But uh yeah,
and uh that that's that's the reason why
is I I don't necessarily think that I'm
I don't think that I'm a very good moral
authority for certain things. Uh like my
my moral like foundation for things is a
little bit, you know, I think kind of
off in some cases, but I think that it
being off also gives me insight in ways
that other people that are on don't
have. So it it I I think I'm just
different, right, in a way. And I this
isn't like a oh I'm not like I'm not
like everybody else. I'm like you know
it's like an anime thing. But like I
just I think that the way that I think
is different than other people and
there's positives and negatives to that,
right? And so yeah.
