It's official. Crypto is maturing beyond pure hype 
and opium. Nowadays, leading crypto projects are
consistently bringing in millions in revenue 
every single month. Every goddamn month. So,
today we're looking at five of the heaviest 
hitters by revenue across a load of sectors from
memecoin launchpads to lending protocols. We'll 
dive into how they work, why the money's flowing,
and how all of this affects token prices if 
current trends hold. My name is Guy, and you're
watching the Coin Bureau. First up, I must make 
one thing clear. I am not a financial adviser,
and nothing in this video should be considered 
financial advice. This is purely educational
content meant to inform you about some of crypto's 
highest earning projects. If that sounds good,
hit those like and subscribe buttons, smash that 
notification bell, and let's get into it. So,
the first protocol we'll look at is Pump.f fun, 
which we'll just call Pump going forward. Now,
Pump is a memecoin launchpad that was set up in 
early 2024 by a semi anonymous trio of founders,
Alan Cohen, Noah Tweedale, and Dylan Kura. Of the 
three, Cohen has taken the lead in representing
the project publicly. Now, the founders built Pump 
with one clear mission. Turn memecoin creation and
trading into a frictionless experience. And 
sure enough, Pump kicked the memecoin market
into overdrive. At its core, Pump is a launchpad 
that enables anyone to spin up a memecoin within
minutes. And once a memecoin is created, it begins 
trading on a special pricing mechanism known as a
bonding curve. Then if it gathers enough traction, 
it migrates to Pump Swap, Pump's native DEX that
launched back in March of this year. The platform 
takes a cut on that non-stop token creation and
the trading activity on Pump Swap that follows. 
And that one-click UX plus instant liquidity has
made Pump a huge success. In fact, since it went 
live, users have launched over 13 million meme
coins. Now, a quick note on terminology before 
we continue. In crypto, fees are considered the
total fees paid by a protocol's users, and revenue 
is the protocol's retained portion after it pays
out other parties like liquidity providers. So, 
fees are a bit like a protocol's gross income,
while revenue is like the protocol's net income. 
For Pump, fees and revenue used to be the exact
same because Pump used to keep 100% of the 
fees, but recently they began sharing a portion
of trading fees with Pump Swap liquidity 
providers and memecoin creators using the
Launchpad. So since then there's a difference 
between fees and revenue. With that in mind,
Pump's revenue continues to hit absolutely 
mind-blowing numbers. In August, the platform
earned $46 million in revenue. And if we consider 
cumulative revenue since its launch, not even 2
years ago, that sits above $810 million. Crazy. 
And those numbers matter beyond bragging rights,
too. In mid July, Pump introduced a very simple 
flywheel. Use platform revenue to buy back its
native Pump token. At the time of shooting, Pump 
has bought back a whopping $100 million worth of
Pump tokens and counting. And that structural bid 
has helped lift the token to new all-time highs,
even as the rest of the market chopped sideways. 
And with the revenue numbers like they are, it's
no wonder on recent high activity days, Pump's 
daily revenue has even outrun major powerhouses
like Hyperlid, a revenu platform we'll touch 
on very soon. So, the key takeaway is that even
a memecoin factory can outearn some of crypto's 
most sophisticated trading stacks when conditions
permit. On top of that, Pump recently went for a 
refreshed push into the creator economy, reviving
its live streaming feature that encourages token 
launchers to uh well work for their backs. These
streams ran into controversy last year, so it 
remains to be seen how effective new monitoring
systems will be, but activity certainly saw an 
uptick on the relaunch. Now, with that backdrop,
the bull case for the pump token is pretty simple, 
just like the platform. If Salana's meme theater
can keep holding attention, then launches and 
trading activity stay strong, revenue stays high,
and buybacks continue to support Pump's price. 
On the bare side, revenue is still far below its
January 2025 peak. In August this year, monthly 
revenue for the entire pump operation was $46
million, which is great, but that's about a third 
of its record month back in January. In fact,
Pump launching the Pump Swap Dex was primarily 
a move to capture more memecoin trading revenue,
specifically due to that drop off in launch 
revenue from its peak. So questions remain
as to whether the trend here is actually down 
and the recent uptick is just a flash in the
pan. Ultimately, without fresh capital, memecoin 
volume doesn't magically reinflate. And getting
back to January 2025 levels probably needs another 
major liquidity wave. And there's also competitive
pressure. With memecoins becoming so big, there's 
a new wave of Pump competitors looking to get a
piece of the action. For now though, Pump is 
number one in both market share and that juicy
juicy revenue. Now, the second cash flow rich 
protocol we'll be looking at today is Axiom.
Axiom was founded by Henry Jang and Preston Ellis, 
two UC San Diego computer science grads who took
the idea through Y Combinator. Ultimately, 
they shipped a trading app designed for
onchain traders who live on the bleeding edge 
of crypto speculation. Launched in early 2025,
Axiom is both one of crypto's fastest growing 
trading startups and one of crypto's fastest
growing platforms. Axiom is an onchain trading 
terminal where users can trade Salana memecoins,
discover freshly minted tokens as soon as they 
launch, and even trade perpetual futures via a
hyperlquid integration. But Salana based memecoin 
trading remains Axiom's bread and butter, and it
brings in the big bucks. Users pay fees for using 
the platform. Axiom returns a cut to traders via
rebates. More on that later, and what's left is 
net revenue for Axiom itself. And with memecoins
being such a major feature of onchain trading 
this cycle, it's no wonder that Axiom's revenue
story is grabbing headlines. Axiom blasted through 
$100 million in revenue within 4 months of launch,
which is crazy for any startup, let alone a crypto 
one. In August alone, the platform brought in over
$31 million in net revenue. That is an impressive 
monthly hall, especially considering we're a far
cry from the peak memecoin mania that we saw back 
in January. And Axiom's positioning in the market
is ideal for revenue capture, as it covers the 
two main drivers behind onchain trading volume,
memecoins and per. And then it bundles them 
into a single fast and intuitive UI. As long
as traders continue to speculate on chain, that 
design compounds. On the other hand, though,
the main risk, similar to pump, is a major 
drop in memecoin market activity. That has
happened before and it will happen again as sharp 
swings are a feature of the sector. But for now,
Axiom's revenue speaks for itself. And as you 
may have noticed, there is one giant kicker here.
Axiom doesn't have a token. But if they ever do 
launch a token and root a share of revenue into
buybacks or some other mechanism for token value 
acrruel, the setup is textbook reflexivity. Cash
flow becomes a bullish narrative for the token 
and the terminal's activity turns into mechanical
demand for the asset. So Axiom is looking very 
strong and that's exactly why now is a great time
to get set up if you're at all inclined to do any 
onchain trading. And if you want to get started,
then be sure to use the link in the description 
below because using that sign up link will give
you 10% cash back for life as well as a 2x points 
multiplier, which will presumably help you get
more of any potential upcoming Axiom airdrop. 
Okay, we've teased this third one enough. The
next highly profitable protocol we're looking at 
today is none other than Hyperlid. Kickstarted by
Jeff Yan, Hyperlquid's core team is intentionally 
tiny, reportedly about 11 people, and yet they've
scaled a self-funded DEX to hundreds of billions 
in monthly trading volume. One distinguishing
feature of Hyperlid is that it's not an app 
built on another chain. It's actually its own
L1. Hyperlid's core DAP is its DEX that runs a 
full onchain order book for Per and Spot. And
in addition to that, there's also Hyper EVM, 
which lets apps build additional DAPs in the
Hyperlquid ecosystem and plug directly into that 
powerful DEX. That split design is largely why it
has sex-like speed without giving up custody and 
why wallets, vaults, and strategy apps are now
building around it. And sure enough, with all that 
activity comes a boatload of revenue. Now, as far
as any distinction between fees and revenue goes, 
almost all fees Hyperlid earns equate to revenue,
although there are rebates in place similar to 
Axiom. But the revenue story is simple. Hyperlid
just posted a record month of $110 million in 
revenue for August. That's up about 23% from
July's tally, numbers that would make a mid-tier 
centralized exchange blush. And that revenue
overwhelmingly stemmed from Hyperlid's Pers 
volume, which has been absolutely insane, hitting
a record of just under $400 billion for August 
alone. And what's more, this has big implications
for the Hype coin. 99% of Hyperlquid fees are 
rooted to an onchain assistance fund that market
buys Hype. Now, the fund is a form of treasury 
or backs stop. It functions as a safety net for
the ecosystem with capital that can be deployed 
in black swan events if needed. But dayto-day
those buybacks act as constant bid pressure. 
More trading, more fees, more buybacks, less
circulating hype. You don't need a spreadsheet 
to understand that loop. You can see it in
Hype's price action. As hyperlquid volumes have 
ripped, so has hype's price with media coverage
explicitly tying the rally to buybacks funded by 
record revenue, adding fuel to the narrative. So
the maths is tough to argue with. If Hyperliquid 
keeps winning market share for Per trading, net
revenue grows and the buyback motor keeps chewing 
through supply. If the team continues to ship
while third-party apps pile into Hyper EVM, you 
get more opportunities for the ecosystem to grow
further. Another tailwind for volumes and revenue. 
And yes, all of this spells buy pressure for the
hype coin. But sustained revenue and dominance in 
onchain per is hard. Competitors are always going
after market share like Binance associated ATA is 
right now. And leverage cycles can turn overnight.
Add scheduled hype unlocks and critiques 
of the protocol's decentralization,
and you've got real risks to watch alongside that 
monster cash flow. Similar to pump and Axiom,
a lull in market volatility or a rotation to 
other venues would cool volumes, thin revenue,
and shrink the buyback bid. And as mentioned, the 
assistance fund is literally designed to sell hype
coins if things really get messy due to any black 
swan event. An unlikely event, sure, but it would
be a pretty nasty development for Hype's price. 
But if the next few quarters look anything like
this summer, things are looking bright. And if 
the market takes another leg up at this juncture,
the reflexivity writes itself. Either way though, 
Hyperlquid is one of the clearest revenue stories
in crypto right now. And full disclosure, I 
hold Hype as part of my personal portfolio. Now,
the fourth protocol on our list is something a bit 
different. Athena. This was founded by Guy Young,
who set out with his team to build a synthetic 
dollar that could stand on its own cash flows
rather than faith alone. Young has been Athena's 
public face, defending the model in interviews and
explaining how the system is designed to survive 
volatility that wrecked stable coin experiments
of the past. Mechanically, Athena's synthetic 
dollar USDE is minted against cryptocolateral
like BTC and ETH and then hedged with matching 
short positions. That creates a so-called
deltaneutral basis trade that skims yield from 
funding rates on futures contracts. The design
is old school finance with a modern onchain twist. 
Long spot, short per collect the spread, repeat.
Unsurprisingly, this model scales with market 
activity. When crypto gets lively, funding rates
rise higher and the amount Athena's system can 
earn rises as well. Unsurprisingly, that flow has
been reflected in the numbers recently. Now, for 
Athena, these numbers show up in fees generated.
That's because the fees generated largely act as 
revenue passed through to users as yield and the
remainder accused to the Athena protocol itself. 
For August, Athena generated $54 million in fees,
plenty of yield rewards for Athena users such 
as USDE stakers. After that was paid out,
Athena still managed to net a tidy $4 million 
in revenue. So, keep in mind that this big gap
between fees and revenue is by design because the 
protocol is set up to directly funnel value to
participants in the Athena ecosystem. But there's 
an exciting twist to this story. A so-called fee
switch. With USDE now listed on Binance, Athena 
says it has satisfied the last requirement to
route a slice of protocol revenue to staked ENA, 
the protocol's native token. That opens a pipeline
from revenue to token holders. That is bullish 
news for ENA and it undoubtedly makes Athena
even more community aligned. Beyond that, Athena 
also benefits from similar tailwinds to the other
venues we've looked at today. Volatility and risk 
appetite. Over the summer, rising funding rates
and fresh deposits pushed flows higher and ENA 
rallied as a result. If that regime persists,
USDE supply and protocol revenue should scale, 
and any active fee share would make staked ENA a
straightforward yield asset on top. But you still 
have to respect the cycle. When funding goes flat
or negative, Athena's model compresses or even 
becomes unfeasible, a weakness in the design.
However, USDE navigated a rough patch last year 
when there was big volatility and frequent dips
into negative funding and it managed it all 
without breaking its $1 peg. Nevertheless,
if we hit an extended riskoff period, expect 
revenue to cool just as quickly as it heated
up. So Athena and USDE are an innovative crypto 
product that is a serious cash machine when crypto
is humming along as it is now. If the market 
turns sleepy and funding dries up, growth falls
and yield falls with it. Either way though, 
the model is transparent enough for investors
to track in real time and it makes potential 
portfolio allocations much more straightforward.
And I'll add that I also hold ENA in my portfolio 
just so you know. So that leads us to the final
revenuerich protocol on today's list. Ave was 
founded by Stani Kletchov and the developer turned
entrepreneur has led an everexpanding team to 
build Ave into a bluechip money market that sits
at the heart of DeFi. At the product level, it's 
simple. Deposit collateral, borrow against it, pay
interest. To keep things running smoothly, loans 
are overcolateralized. That means you can only
borrow a fraction of what your crypto is worth and 
that helps minimize any risk of liquidation. That
machine runs across multiple pools and blockchain 
networks and collectively it boasts a massive
$40 billion in total value locked. But where does 
Ave's revenue come from? Well, similar to Athena,
Ave sees a majority of fees generated go directly 
to the protocol participants that deserve them.
Simply put, Avease's fees mostly equal 
the interest borrowers pay to lenders or
liquidity providers. The protocol's revenue is 
the slice it retains for facilitating this plus
things like flash loans and liquidation fees. 
So, just like Athena, fees dwarf revenue here,
but that is by design and lenders receiving those 
interest payments could certainly consider those
payments as revenue. And in any case, the final 
cut that Ave does receive is nothing to sneeze at
either. Last August alone, the protocol generated 
$94 million in fees and saw a sizable $13 million
in revenue. That's all while those interest 
payments made their way to lenders in an automated
and seamless manner. Exactly the vision crypto 
pioneers had for smart contracts and blockchain
networks. Now, similar to other projects on 
today's list, the token angle sharpened this
year. In April, the Ave community approved 
buybacks as part of a tokconomics overhaul,
greenlighting the DAO to purchase Ave on the open 
market. To date, the program has accumulated 0.5%
of total AR supply, worth about $25 million at 
the time of making this video. Now there is more
in store for a revamp of Ave's tokconomics in the 
coming months which we won't dive into today but
the trend is clear. More value will acrue to token 
holders and of course that's good news for the Ave
token itself. So Ave is growing and the Ave token 
is aligned with that growth. But what moves it
from here? Well, above all else, if crypto's bull 
market continues and borrowing remains elevated,
which it tends to in bullish conditions, then 
Ave's bottom line remains juicy and buybacks
have real fuel. Sprinkle in some tokconomics 
tweaks that funnel more value to Ave holders
and things look very good for the protocol's 
token. But if we get bearish or choppy conditions,
that story obviously gets flipped. Lower 
risk appetites, softer demand, lower rates,
and fewer liquidations all mean lower protocol 
revenue. Either way though, Ave's model is another
transparent one that we can track in real time. So 
that's really all there is to it. And well folks,
those are five of the major revenue generating 
protocols in crypto. But did we exclude one of
