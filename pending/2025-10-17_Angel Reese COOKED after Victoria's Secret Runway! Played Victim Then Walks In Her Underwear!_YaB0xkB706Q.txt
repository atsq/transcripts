You're tuning into
Black and White Sports on YouTube. The
no holds barred truth on sports. The
main event starts. All right, black and
white sports supporters. Well, I got to
tell you, in a vacuum,
if Angel Ree or any other WNBA player
wanted to do a Victoria Models photo
shoot, walk the walk the runway, make
those extra dollars, I would not care.
Even if it is Angel Reese, I wouldn't
give a damn.
Except
in the case of Angel Ree, there is
precedent
that she felt like she was being
sexualized, that she was a victim of
something. Let let's just before we get
to the footage,
and I'm and the reaction, and there's a
lot of reaction, let me tell you. Let's
just let's just go back. My boy Brandon
Tatum right here. This was a video he
put up a while back. And this is this is
Angel. Let's make sure we have context
here.
>> I've been attacked so many times.
Death threats. I've been sexualized.
>> Meanwhile,
>> big mama.
>> Big mama. That mama for real.
>> I've been death threats. I've been
sexual. She's been celebrated, bro. They
won a national championship. They
kissing her ashy elbows.
>> But everybody remembers it, right?
That's a national title.
I've been I I've been I've been
sexualized, played the victim in front
of everybody.
But today, we're walking the one runway
in our underwear. Again, if you want to
walk the runway, I don't care. You might
be like, "Well, Roads, Sophie Cunningham
and bikinis and blah." Sophie
Cunningham's never come out and played
the victim of anything.
And if Angel Reese hadn't have done
that, if she hadn't have played that
victim card,
I wouldn't give a rat's ass that she's
doing this. But yeah, if you're going to
be that big, that large of a hypocrite,
you're going to get called out for it.
Of course you are.
I I mean, honestly, I'm still trying to
figure out why the guy that created the
MeiBounds thing on TikTok isn't suing
her over the Mei Bounds thing.
She literally just snatched that from a
content creator. He ought to snatch it
right back if he was smart.
I mean, I had people send me, "Dude,
this is a Tik Tok thing."
Well, I don't know.
I don't know if that's accurate or not,
but I'm just telling you, oh, that's a
smart business move. It's smart until
the guy that that created it comes
calling. It might not be so smart.
And I've largely quit doing Angel
Reese's videos because I'm gonna be
honest, people have have gotten to the
point in a lot of for a lot of videos,
they don't care what she's doing
anymore.
She's losing her steam.
Yeah. Honestly, I'm being real. If I
thought people would watch, I'd make
videos on it. But there she is. There
she is
walking the runway in her draws.
There she is in her draws.
Okay, so that was her Victoria Secrets.
Uh, Victoria Secretions right here. No,
I'm turning this down. And I'm not
trying to get copyright. There she is
striking a pose like this is this is
vogue or something. But don't sexualize
mem.
Uhuh.
Don't you do it.
Nah. See that? That's that's where I got
the problem.
That's where I got the problem. It's not
the bikinis and all that. No.
I mean, I've, you know, I made a video a
while back that that that
there's not enough feminine women in the
WNBA
and and them being and they're afraid to
show that they're some of them are
beautiful women,
you know,
but don't play the victim and then go
out and literally do the thing
and expect people. Uh, don't sexualize
me. Don't look at me like that. I mean,
I know I'm walking out my draws, but
you're you're not allowed to do that.
Nah, no, no, no, no, no, no. Doesn't
work like this. This is not Burger King.
You don't get to have it your way
regardless
of whether you want it your way or not.
Dom Lree
right here. Gross.
I mean, you see it. She was going to get
crushed.
And here we are.
Much better.
I got the Trump girls on there. Uh, I
guess there's something there. This
guy's not feeling. What happened to
crying and saying you didn't want to be
sexualized?
I mean, that's that's the question.
She looks like a character from the
movie Ants.
At least she shaved her mustache. That
[ __ ] was getting out of hand.
Oh god.
I mean, wow.
Wow.
I mean, you just you just knew
it was going to get Isn't she a
professional athlete? Why does she have
cheese on her back? Woo! What happened?
She didn't want to be sexualized.
Get back to me when Sophie Cunningham
does this walk instead
again. Oh, but Roads, you're a
hypocrite. No, I'm not. Sophie
Cunningham didn't never come out and
say, "I'm being a victim. I'm playing
the victim." People are sexualizing me.
So, she ain't crying nowhere like that.
Liz Cabbage didn't either and she doing
things I don't re recommend or condone
any of these women going to only fans. I
don't
if you want to do tasteful modeling
that's up to you.
But do not
play the victim. Wasn't she the one
whining because she felt the WNBA was
quote sexualizing her? She said it when
she was still in college. This is This
is her coming out in college. Right
there. That's at the LSU
postgame presser where she wanted
everybody
to cry. I got tagged right here. Stop
sexualizing me. Angel Ree, quote, "Stop
sexualizing me." Also, Angel Ree walks
in her underwear.
And I mean, and yeah, she's getting a
lot of people that that are okay with
her, too. Damn, did she shave her
mustache,
walks like a guy as she screams, "Don't
sexualize me." This guy even says, "I'm
still a fan of of her play on the
court."
What the hell happened to her eyes?
She'll literally do anything but
basketball.
I mean, if I was her, I probably
wouldn't go this route because you you
knew she was going to take heat. But
look, I I think she's to the point and
it's one of the reasons that that that
uh uh I quit making a lot of videos
because I mean she doesn't have
I mean she doesn't have the
self-awareness to understand
people trying to actually help her.
I mean, honestly,
played the vict. I got a major problem
when people start playing the victim and
then they go out and do something
something like this that is hypocritical
as hell. Yeah, you going to get called
out on it. You surely are.
That comment, that statement from that
presser will follow her forever as long
as she tries to do and continues to do
things like this. The twerking, the the
ass shaking, all this stuff.
Dad, stop sexualizing. I don't I don't
care if she wants to dance around, be
provocative.
That's not the problem unless you've
played the victim prior.
Yeah, people going to call you out on
it. They sure are. Tell me what you
think.
Peace I'm out. Till next time.
