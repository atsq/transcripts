Wake the up, samurai.
We have a city to burn.
Okay, so first of all, you guys will
have to forgive me cuz I'm not meant to
be doing streams like this. I'm meant to
be playing [ __ ] dress up in my room
playing video games. Okay, I did not
want to have to do like a stream like
this. Like it feels like I'm doing like
a [ __ ] press conference or something.
But first of all, uh hope you guys are
uh all feeling okay. Sorry you had to
see that. You know what I'm supposed to
be doing right now? Actually, I'm
supposed to be going over my run of show
for my TwitchCon show, which uh I am
still doing, by the way, because um
of all the work that the production
staff and the cosplayers in it put into
it. It's not their fault that happened.
I'm still going to do it. Um
but yeah, I don't even know where to
[ __ ] start. I don't know if you guys
can see this. I wrote [ __ ] notes for
this because there's so much stuff that
I feel like I needs to be talked about,
which is also why I was very aggressive
in my tweet earlier today, which is I
mean, you guys know me. I am never like
that. But I just feel like in a way it's
my responsibility. You know what I mean?
Because it's not just about me. Like
this could have happened to anyone.
Honestly, for all we know, this could
have already happened to someone, a
small streamer, and someone just wasn't
filming it. Which, okay, I'll just I'll
just start this by saying shout out to
the guy who filmed it and put it on
Twitter because last night after this
happened, I was thinking like, [ __ ]
like, I have to talk about this. Like,
people need to know that this happened.
Like, how am I going to do that? And
then someone happened to post it on
Twitter. So, thank [ __ ] god I I
didn't have to figure that out myself.
Um, which, okay, like I said, this is
gonna be a mess because I'm not meant to
be doing these kinds of streams.
I don't think that Twitch would have put
out an official statement if that clip
wasn't posted and going viral.
And even after the fact that that clip
was posted and going viral, I as far as
I know, the other people who had meet
and greets today were not reached out to
to ask if they wanted extra security or
if they even wanted to cancel their meet
and greet. Like maybe some people were,
but um I know for a fact extra Emily
wasn't.
Um my personal manager made sure that
she had extra security. No one reached
out to her. don't know about everyone,
but I know that for a fact.
Okay, so
let's just start from the beginning
because I want to have be able to run
through everything before the show
starts. The show starts in a [ __ ]
hour.
Okay. Um, my notes are a [ __ ] mess.
It looks like a skitso board. Um,
but yeah, again, thank you to the guy
that put it on Twitter. Thank you to the
people that talked about it because
otherwise I don't know if anything would
have been done or it would have been
taken seriously straight up.
So I'm just going to go through from my
perspective what happened when I saw the
order of events. Um, so I was doing my
meet and greet and I've seen people
saying that it was an obligation given
to me, uh, like to be a featured creator
and to have my show, I had to do a meet
and greet, which is true. I was told
that I had to do a meet and greet. Um,
but as far as I know, there's some
people that canled. Regardless, I didn't
cancel. I I thought it was going to be
fine. So, um, I show up at 4. I'm doing
my meet and greet. Um,
this happened about 30 minutes into my
meet and greet. So, I was probably only
like 20 to 30% done with my meet and
greet.
Um,
I was just taking a picture with someone
else, like completely normal nice guy.
Um, and then I see out of the corner of
my eye there's a guy walking around the
side of the meet and greet and he
crosses in front of the meet and greet
of the person to the left of me which is
a VTuber. So he he's able to walk up and
in front of another streamer's meet and
greet and then he walks up to me and he
he's like walking with a purpose, you
know what I mean? Um,
and he he grabs me
But I'm like, "Wait, what the fuck?"
Like, but I in in my head I'm like, it's
it seems like he's supposed to be here.
And then he leans and like he's going to
tell me something. So in my head I'm
like, maybe it's like TwitchCon staff
like coming to let me know something cuz
like sometimes that'll happen where
you're at an event and someone will like
come up to like let you know something.
You know what I mean? Um
but I'm still like freaked out because
he grabbed me. That's not normal. And
then he grabs my face and he leans in
and lips puckered tries to kiss me and I
start screaming. You can't hear it in
the clip, but I'm [ __ ] screaming my
head off. And then my security, Twitch's
security is like nowhere near me,
nowhere to be found. I can see them, but
they they don't do anything. Um, my
security jumps up and shoves a guy away
from me and is like, "Get the [ __ ] out
of here." and he's allowed to walk away
and leave.
Um, yeah. So then after this point, I
did not see a lot of what happened here.
This is just based off what people in
the line told me. Uh, my friend Bonnie
who was there told me and Melissa, my
manager told me. So the the woman who
moved me away from the meet and greet
was my personal manager. That was not
Twitch staff. No one in Twitch staff
came up to me to like see what was going
on.
Uh my manager and Bonnie moved me to the
back and they're like hugging me and
being like, "Uh, do you want to finish
your meet and greet?" basically. Um
and I I was back there for like a minute
and I was like, "You know what? Like I I
want to finish it cuz like of all these
people here that you know,
they're just nice normal people." And I
go back out there and still there's no
one from Twitch there. And the poor guy
that I was taking the picture with
originally, he he looks he's he's like
[ __ ] mortified and he's like so he's
like, "What the [ __ ] just happened?" And
again,
no one from Twitch there. I I say to
this guy, I'm like, "I'm sorry you had
to see that." And he's like, "No, like
I'm so sorry that happened to you. Why
am I having to tell the TwitchCon
attendees and my fans, sorry you had to
see that, and not like someone from
Twitch or Twitch security. Anyway, um,
so I didn't see this. This is just what
my friend and my manager were telling
me. Um,
the Twitch security like kind of like
got together after that and we were
like, "Wait, what happened?" Oh, I
didn't even see what happened. Haha. and
just like started talking about
something else. So, it's like, okay. And
then
that's the the events of what happened
just to like line all that up.
But I didn't talk at all about the
aftermath of all of this at all. And I
don't think anyone knows this save for
like maybe some streamers that I'm
friends with that came to spend time
with me or that I talked to last night.
Okay. Um,
I So, I finished the meet and greet and
I was escorted back to my hotel by my
one security guard. Oh, and also by the
way, I uh I've seen clips people
bringing up clips of me talking about
how my previous favorite security guard
was permab from TwitchCon because um at
a previous TwitchCon two years ago, I
believe I think it was two years ago, uh
there was a stalker and he held him by
the arm until police got there and
because of that he was indefinitely
banned from TwitchCon, like from all of
TwitchCon, not just the venue because
that was in Las Vegas. Anyway, that just
just a side note. Okay. Um,
man, I wrote down a lot of [ __ ] here.
C can I just also say what you guys are
seeing here is character development.
I've always been the person who never
says [ __ ] Like, I just want everyone to
have fun and for things to go well.
Why am I the person who has to do this?
So, I'm Anyway, after I'm escorted back
to my hotel,
um I let some of my friends know they
come to my hotel to see me and spend
time with me, like make sure I'm okay
and everything. Um and then my manager
is letting me know. She says, "Okay, I
I've she my manager, I've contacted the
police. They're going to come talk to
you about pressing charges, etc. They're
trying to find the guy. They haven't
found him.
I'm like, what? He Anyway.
Anyway, um
so at at some point while I'm with my
friends, a police officer comes and
talks to me, interviews me, interviews
my manager, talks to my uh Twitch
partner manager, who by the way, she's
so sweet. Like, she she didn't do
anything wrong here. Um,
all of that happens and then I'm
complaining to my friends. I'm like,
"The [ __ ] do I do here, guys? Like, I
have to I have to talk about this blah
blah blah." And they're like, "Oh, like
don't worry about that right now." And
then suddenly wakes like, "Wait, why is
my Discord saying hope Emy's okay?" And
I'm like, "Oh, fuck." I guess the clip
got posted again. Thank god someone was
filming because otherwise I don't think
Twitch would have sent me a thing. Um,
so after that I start getting a lot of
messages. I'm responding to people and
my manager comes back to me and she's
upset. She's like, "Okay, uh, I've been
talking to Twitch people and I'm really
upset because I noticed a lot of
negligence around the event and I'm not
happy with the way that they're handling
it now." And I'm like, "What do you
mean?" And she's like, "Well, um, I
asked them, you know, like what are they
going to do about this?" And you know
what they said initially?
They said, "Oh, well, he's banned from
the platform for 30 days."
What? And then she's obviously like,
"Hello." Like, that needs to be a
definite. What the [ __ ] are you talking
about? All has like nothing to do with
anything. No one gives a [ __ ] if he's
banned on Twitch or not. like we're
talking about the convention here. So
they they change it to indefinite. Takes
takes an hour for that to happen. By the
way, uh these two people are um the head
of security for Amazon and the head of
risk for Twitch.
Also, later the same night, I'm not
going to drop names here because I
wasn't there, so I didn't see it, but I
had multiple people tell me that key
Twitch representatives last night were
out partying.
Okay.
Uh,
oh, also another detail. Sorry, my my
lines are all crazy here. Um
um my Twitch Twitch didn't approach my
manager to talk to their head of
security. It took them two hours to
approach her to talk about what
happened. And by then she had already
talked to police and called a lawyer on
her own, my manager Melissa.
And uh they showed her a photo of the
guy that I I believe a fan took. By the
way, a fan took a photo of him, not one
of their security guards. They're like,
"Oh, yeah. Here's his photo. Uh, we're
like going to find him." He still had
his badge and his wristband and
everything, the guy.
So, um, yeah, I I really feel like a lot
of this process wouldn't have happened
if it weren't for my manager advocating
for me so hard, which again
um, I'll get to that later. I I'll keep
going here. So they they also showed my
manager um some security footage of the
area and the guy was able he was waiting
for there to be a gap in security and
there was he was able to walk through
the side not through like the two lanes
of uh meet and greet people who had
signed up and been like background
checked for my meet and greet. He was
able to just walk through because there
just wasn't like consistent security
there.
Oh my gosh. And then um so yeah, that's
basically
my day yesterday.
And then today um this morning
I was told that um Amazon flew in their
global head of something to redesign the
whole process and security of the con
for the rest of the convention.
Why wasn't there someone like that here
already? Or like they didn't do that
beforehand? Like, hello. I'm sorry. Um,
so yeah, they I guess they know that
they [ __ ] up really bad if they're
flying in their global Amazon's global
head.
And also, I I want to make it clear so
that people understand this. I am so
lucky and privileged. Okay. Do you know
how much I spent on security to be able
to come to this event in the first
place? Like, but I I'm not just talking
about yesterday. I'm talking about my
security for like my RV trip that I did
with my friends and stuff. I spent over
$10,000.
Some people who stream on Twitch don't
even make $10,000 in a year. What the
[ __ ] are they supposed to do? Like if
you watch the clip, the security guard
who pushes the guy away is my security.
The woman who pulls me to the back, my
manager. If you're a small streamer and
you don't have those resources or
someone in your line's not filming, what
the [ __ ] do you do?
No one would have known.
Like it's it's actually [ __ ] insane.
Like I like I I'm genuinely angry. Like
I
am not an angry person. Like it it's
just ridiculous. And like honestly I I
genuinely think there have been other
people who have been
sexually assaulted, groped, like who
[ __ ] knows worse at these
conventions. And just nobody knows
because like I said, they didn't post
any kind of announcement, weren't
letting other streamers with similar
events as me, similar meet and greets
know until there was like a viral clip.
And by the way, they they can't even
mention my name in it. Thank you guys.
Thank you. Uh
and okay, hold on. Let me let me pull up
what they wrote because
that that was another thing that was
crazy to wake up to. Um,
all right. Let me read this. The safety
and security of all those attending
TwitchCon is our highest priority. The
behavior displayed by the individual
involved in the incident yesterday with
involving a high-profile streamer was
completely unacceptable and deeply
unsettling. in line with existing
TwitchCon security protocols. Law
enforcement event security were on site.
That's a lie. That's literally a lie.
And responded to the incident. We
immediately blocked this individual from
returning to the TwitchCon premises and
they're banned indeed definitely from
Twitch both online and inerson events.
Okay. Like no one cares about online. We
are courting with the impacted creators
team. That that's true. And per our
standard protocols, continue to
cooperate with any law enforcement
investigations. We've increased security
at the meet and greet attendee check-in
point and we'll have additional security
personnel surrounding participating
streamers. If you've RSVPd for a meet
and greet, please note that we're unable
to accommodate plus ones for the
remainder of the event. You know why
they said that? They only they only
thought about that because of Melissa,
my manager. She said, "Were you vetting
people coming through the line?" They
said, "Oh, yeah. Everyone had to sign up
and uh they get background checks, but
uh they're allowed to bring a plus one.
Well, are there plus ones background
checked? No.
Melissa was like, "Okay, guys. Um,
Twitch has a zero tolerance for
harassment or act inhibit the safety and
security of our community." Um,
yeah. Um,
yeah. I I don't even know. Like, I'm I'm
just tired, guys. It's like I'm just so
tired of
I I've just had so many things happen
and like you know stuff just happens
like especially when you're like a
creator or like a girl creator in
particular, but I just feel like I've
been failed so many times or lied to so
many times and I'm always like, you
know, it's okay. We'll figure it out.
You should have figured it out already.
You should have [ __ ] figured it out
already.
Oh my god.
So yeah. Um that's basically unless I'm
forgetting something a rundown of
everything. Um
but yeah, it's just it's [ __ ] insane.
And I mean
I'm not usually the type of person to
talk about this stuff, but it's like
well did I lie about anything? No. like
what are you gonna you're gonna be mad
at me for telling like the things that
y'all did wrong
and like okay so another thought that I
had was like maybe maybe like the reason
Twitch said in their thing like oh
security immediately got the guy maybe
like you know they hired like shitty
security and they like lied to them so
they wouldn't like you know lose their
job or not get paid. Maybe if you guys
had like, you know, actual cameras and
like good comms, no one would be able to
lie or have to lie. Like, why why is it
better to or like easier to find out
something happened in [ __ ] Among Us
than at TwitchCon? Hello.
This is [ __ ] insane.
But yeah, um I just want to tell you
guys all that
uh this is character development. I'm
I'm [ __ ] sick of it. I'm so sick of
it. Like this this was just the final
straw for me.
Oh my goodness.
Oh.
But yeah, um
I have been Okay. some something else.
Sorry, I just I just keep remembering
[ __ ] It's going to be like this for the
rest of the stream. Uh
I saw a thing that said I was in their
like top five or top five or top 10 most
followed streamers attending this event.
Again, if that happened to me, what the
[ __ ] is happening to small creators that
we don't even hear about because no
one's filming them? like they tweet it
and like Twitch doesn't feel the need to
follow up with them or publicly.
It's just
But yeah, I think I covered everything
and
I've uh been a streamer on Twitch for 10
years. I attended the very first or
maybe the second TwitchCon ever in a
2016 2015
and um
yeah like I I understand back then it
was different but I I feel like
there like I know they say there's
security upgrades but it really feels
like there's not like another thing that
um happened I forgot to mention.
So, the way that the meet and greet
worked is like people light up, they
come through, they take a picture, then
they're supposed to walk through the
back and leave. There were people
walking through the back trying to come
up to my booth or like I mean, not all
of them were like malicious intent
obviously. Like, some people would leave
and be like, "Oh [ __ ] my picture is
bad. I'm going to go back and ask for
another one." And my manager had to be
the one to tell them like, "Oh, no, you
can't like keep moving." And there was
even like I think it was [ __ ] neon
was able to walk through the back
through the back of my meet and greet
and was like, "Oh, hey, like can I come
say hi?" And it's like, "What the fuck?"
Like, oh my god. It It was just
horrible. Like there was no thought put
into it at all. Um
and yeah, I was like, "Man, it's just
[ __ ] it's just [ __ ] naked and
afraid out here." You're like, "Thank
God I have my manager and my security
and my friends, but like I just feel so
bad for, you know, Twitch creators who
wouldn't be able to be in that position.
Are you okay, though?" Um,
this is going to sound [ __ ] up,
honestly. I'm so desensitized to stuff
like that that when it happens, I kind
of just go into like lock in mode. I'm
like, "Okay, I need to just lock in and
like get through this.
Worry about it later." So that that's
how I was able to finish my meet and
greet. Like my friends were telling me
like, "Bro, if it was me, I would have
been crying. You're built different for
going back out there." And like I said,
I was going back out there and having to
apologize to people in my own line.
Being like, "I'm sorry you saw that. I
hope you're okay." And then they of
course were like, "What the [ __ ] Why
are you saying that to me?" But I felt
like I had to because no one else was
there.
And uh like I said on Twitter um
like I really wish I didn't have this
opinion. Like I love trying to be like
the positive like oh let's get together
and have fun everyone. Uh
I really like would discourage other
creators from going back to TwitchCon.
Not just because
because it was able to happen at all and
what happened during it and the
aftermath.
Like
it's it's just crazy. Like
why why why would their PR team say
that? Like you can literally see in the
clip that he's allowed to walk away.
But yeah, um thank you guys. Um
appreciate all the support and stuff. It
was pretty crazy um getting all the
messages and stuff last night. And
again, I've said it like five [ __ ]
times. Thank [ __ ] God that someone
was filming and decided to post it
because if not, you know what I would be
doing today? I would be so [ __ ]
stressed being like, "Okay,
do I have to disrupt my stuff that I
have planned to announce that this thing
happened to me and let people know that
it could happen to them."
So, thank [ __ ] God for that guy.
Like, thank you so much for doing that.
Um,
and
I would just encourage everyone just to
stand the [ __ ] up.
Stand up for yourself. stand up for
other people because if you don't,
look what [ __ ] happens. Which is
crazy because I saw Valkyrie, I saw
Pokey, I saw Hassan, I saw Cutie saying,
"I don't really want to go to TwitchCon
because I don't feel safe." And everyone
was saying that they were stupid or
overreact. Not everyone, but a lot of
people. A large portion of people were
saying that. And Twitch's response to
that was to be like, "Oh, don't worry
everyone else. Uh, we up security.
I should have listened to them,
especially because I mean, a lot of
people know stuff like this has happened
to me in the past and I just keep going.
Like, I'm I'm the kind of person that's
like, you know what? I'm not going to
let a shitty person or a shitty thing
ruin my life or like what's going on for
me. You know what I mean? [ __ ] it. We
ball.
So, I was like, I'm going to go anyway.
I'm just gonna be smart. I'm gonna pay
for security. I'm only gonna do my show.
How is someone gonna attack me at my
show? I'm only going to do my meet and
greet. How the [ __ ] would they get into
a meet and greet? It's It's roped off
with security.
Nope.
Nope. Lesson learned. Um
and also after it happened, uh Twitch
did offer if I wanted some of their
Twitch security. I was like,
I'm good, bro. But I was lucky enough
that um Clemens, who is one of my usual
security guards, flew out from Austin,
Texas this morning to be there with me
today.
Have to go to likes like that. And uh I
have two other security guards. One of
them's Amazon's, but I have my personal
security guard I feel comfortable with
is like my main guy. Um and they said
that they like change security for the
show and stuff, but yeah, I'm I'm just
done. Like this is the kind of thing
that it's like once you break the trust
for something like this, you're you're
never getting it back. I'm sorry. You're
just not like it's not like this is the
first time that something like this has
happened. It's like the trust was
already kind of broken and that caused a
lot of people to not want to come. Like
for example, people were talking about
how last year uh Nick and LOL and Wake
Wilder
got assaulted. A guy literally walked up
to Nick on stream and licked his nipple,
which again, if that wasn't filmed on
stream, would anything have been done? I
don't [ __ ] know. And they didn't even
make like an official announcement about
it. They didn't reach out to Nick as far
as I know. He was saying that last year,
so I if they did reach out to him, it
was way after the con. Um, so it's like,
did they just not think it was a big
deal? Is it because Nick's a guy?
Like,
hello.
I'm supposed to be working on my run a
show right now. Um, I am still doing the
show, like I said, because of uh the
production staff worked really hard on
it and the cosplayers involved worked
really hard on it. So, I I still want to
do it, but this is going to be my last
TwitchCon show. I'm doing it with Baby
No Money and Will Nef. So,
even though we haven't really had time
to go over this in practice, uh it'll be
fine. It'll be a [ __ ] show, but it'll be
fine. I'm sure it'll be fun. Um lots of
talented people working in Twitch
production and uh
all that. It's uh
yeah.
Anyway, um, how we feeling, you guys?
Yeah, I'm flying home tomorrow and my
security guard's going to be
accompanying me to fly home. But it it's
just sad the world that we live in now.
Like to me, I I don't even think of
myself as like
someone
that needs to be protected or like
someone important. But it's like,
you know, I was talking about how like I
wanted to buy a new hamster recently.
I was thinking about how if I if I want
to do that on stream, I'd have to hire
security to go buy a [ __ ] hamster.
And like I said, I spent over $10,000
alone just to come to TwitchCon for
security. I've probably spent close to
six figures total going to cons
uh stuff on security. And again, it's
not like this only happens to people of
my size. This happens to to girls or
guys with 50 viewers. What the [ __ ] are
they supposed to do? They can't afford
that. It's like you got to just deal
with it. Not or you're
that's another thing. I could have
[ __ ] died yesterday.
But yeah, um obviously
I'm going to be making my own personal
changes going forward. I already have
like for years. But I'm just really hurt
and disappointed by how everything was
set up by Twitch and like how it was
handled after. Um,
like honestly that ups was upsetting me
more and making me more angry last night
than everything else. Like it's like
okay,
you know, any any person can be walking
on the street and get assaulted. Like
yeah, it's it's [ __ ] horrible. It's
[ __ ] horrible. But why do I have to
worry about that happening at the
convention for the place that I work?
I don't know if I'm just talking in
circles now, but um
I don't know, guys. Um
y'all see my fit for the show.
Bonnie helped me put it together and
I've got the heels.
Shows in [ __ ] 28 minutes. Um, [ __ ]
me.
Uh, I'm sure it'll be fine. I'm just I'm
just going to try to have fun. Uh, try
to like, you know, let the cosplayers
and people that came to participate in
it shine.
And then I'm going home.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir. Um,
trying to remember if I forgot to touch
anything else.
I think that's pretty much it. Um,
yeah, this stream [ __ ] sucked. I feel
like I'm being forced to do a press
conference because it's like if I don't
say these things, no one is going to.
And then they're just gonna act like it
never happened next year.
Great. Uh, love it. Remember when I was
just a girl in Kansas playing League in
my room and the worst thing that ever
happened to me was someone said I was
like a boosted [ __ ] in chat or
something? Wish I could go back to that.
Um,
what else? Uh, shout out to my friends,
all the people that reached out to me.
Um,
I remember Lucari in particular was
like, "Yo, Emmy, you need another
security guard? I I can be there. I'll
I'll make sure that I'll I'll keep you
safe." Lucari offered to be my an extra
security guard. I was like, "A thanks,
bro."
Um
yeah, my brain is mush, bro.
I'm cooked. Um,
but yeah, this um
this was kind of like I guess you could
say like a climax for me in my character
development cuz this year already um
I know there's a lot of people that
watch me that are kind of similar to me
in some regards in terms of being like a
more like timid or like glass half full
type of person or like wanting to
believe the best in people type of
person.
Um, I still believe that you can be that
way and I still believe that I'm still
that way. But I've definitely
come to realize
and I really want everyone to really
think about this. You have to stand the
[ __ ] up for yourself, for other people,
because if you don't, there's a lot of
people who are just going to take the
easy lazy route because it doesn't
affect them, so they don't care. like a
lot of the people that were hired to
work on this event.
And I obviously I don't
I've been through so many horrible
things. I don't want things like this to
happen to other people or at least for
it to not be that easy for it to happen
to other people. I do feel like it's
partially my responsibility. Um
I mean not to like make sure things
don't happen, but to let people know
that these kinds of things happen
because they should know. And again,
it's crazy that nothing was said about
this publicly or to other creators who
had similar events as me until there was
a viral clip.
But yeah, it's just it's been
crazy weekend.
Crazy [ __ ] weekend.
But yeah, I love you guys. I'm not going
to stop streaming. I'm not going to
stop, you know, trying to interact with
fans in a in a safe way.
Maybe no more convention streams, which
is sad because I I love convention
streams, but I mean, it is what it is.
You can't can't control the weather. You
know what I'm saying?
Um, but yeah, I just really hope that
nothing else happens to anyone else this
weekend.
um that we're not hearing any more
terrible stories
and um I really feel like the only way
to hold
people accountable is to show that it's
not okay
by things by for example like I was
saying creators not going to these
events because a lot of these tickets
are sold uh via meet and greets like
what I was doing.
And I really feel like I was treated
like cattle or merchandise
cuz why why is no one there making sure
I'm safe like a person? Why are the
security guards joking and laughing and
be like, "Oh, I didn't even see what
happened."
It's crazy, man. I want to play [ __ ]
I want to play [ __ ] Mega Bonk, bro.
So [ __ ] annoying. So [ __ ]
annoying.
Um, and yeah, I don't I don't even care
if I lose any like opportunities or
anything for talking about this cuz it's
it's [ __ ] insane. And another thing
I've realized is sometimes if you don't
say something, no one else is going to.
Sometimes you have to be the one that,
you know, steps up and starts the
conversation.
And yeah, like I said, this isn't even
the first thing that happened because my
friends Nick and Wake, it happened to
them last year. And yeah, maybe just cuz
they're men or something, it wasn't
taken seriously, which is [ __ ]
insane.
Yeah, stay stay safe, guys. Look out for
your friends.
Um, you know, if you're here this
weekend, uh, you know, stay in groups.
Um,
and I I mean I would love to know if
like other things have happened to other
smaller creators and it's just being
drowned out because Twitch isn't giving
them the same attention that they're
giving me. I would love to know even if
it happened in the past because it's
[ __ ] ridiculous. Like, yes, I know
these things happen at cons, but when
the con literally exists because of your
small and big creators,
it it should not be this kind of an
issue
where it's like talked about to this
extent.
My goodness.
Yeah, I I would love to know. I I think
you guys should post about it if
something happened to you. Like, please
do.
Oh, I need a minute. Sorry. Give me a
sec.
Yeah, I'm just very angry.
Not just because of what happened to me,
but because of what it implies about
other people. Because if if I wasn't
important,
there's hundreds of thousands of people
that stream on Twitch.
Like,
I I don't know. I just want I genuinely,
again, I hate being this kind of person.
I genuinely want people to be held
accountable and for things to like
visibly be changed. But even so, I
personally am not going to another
TwitchCon. I'm done. 10 years of
streaming. I'm done. This is my final
TwitchCon.
This show will be my final performance.
And then I'm going back to streaming
video games in my room
in my house that probably has more
cameras around it than TwitchCon.
But yeah, um
I yeah, I hope if this happened to any
any other creators, you know, that you
are cared about and people do want to
know.
And yeah. Um,
yeah, that was a a lot. Sorry, guys. I
hate uh
hate the heavy stuff.
Really hate the heavy stuff.
And I know there's some some uh some
people at Twitch and Amazon watching
right now. Please like please just
listen. Like people aren't saying this
for no reason. Like I feel like you guys
don't get it or something. Like I could
have literally been stabbed yesterday.
Literally. Like
uh I have also seen people asking if I'm
uh if I'm like taking any type of legal
action. Uh, I am pressing charges
against the guy um with the police.
As for anything else, uh, I don't know
yet because I've been having my manager
handle all of those like side
conversations.
So, I I have no idea. But I I don't This
is It's just not okay.
But at the bare minimum, I will be
pressing charges against the guy that
was there, obviously. Like, duh.
Um,
yes, sir.
I mean, it's also kind of funny. I'm
literally doing this in TwitchCon. They
just gave me a a an empty conference
room to just [ __ ]
dispel everything. But yeah, I I really
feel like there's a lot of key people
that are responsible that need to be
held accountable
because clearly there's been multiple
points of failure for this to have even
happened in the first place.
And again, forgive me if I'm just
rambling in circles,
but I I do also want to say, you know,
there there's a lot of people that work
at Twitch that are lovely, amazing,
creative people. It's not them, but
there's definitely multiple people that
their failure allowed this to happen.
Multiple people, for sure.
I I don't have any doubt about that.
Especially because of the fact that they
flew out the global head of Amazon to
talk to my my manager and my security
guard today.
But yeah, we're going to do our show
with Will and Baby No Money.
We're going to try to have fun uh during
it. Uh, I know a lot of you guys are
still mad, but I'd prefer if we could
just not talk about it, just like focus
on the show and like the people in the
show, not just be spamming like [ __ ]
Twitch or whatever, you know? Um,
yeah. Um, because like I said, there's a
lot of people that worked on the show
that had absolutely nothing to do with
what happened yesterday. I would like to
for them to still, you know, be able to
have a good show and, you know, feel
like people enjoyed it. Um, and that it
was fun because I I didn't do a lot of
work on the show. Like, I came up with a
lot of the concept,
but uh I only did probably like one to
two% of the actual setup and production.
So,
yeah, I I don't want to be unfair to
those people.
Um,
yeah, I have to head over there in like
five minutes.
I do have one more thing to say, but
just give me a sec.
Guys, no one's going to be mad at me if
I go home and play League of Legends at
this point, right? Like, I [ __ ]
deserve it, okay?
said, "I have a weird mouth tick when
I'm stressed
and I feel it.
All right, guys. Five minutes to show
time.
Yeah. I don't know.
Like I said, I'm okay. I'm fine because
not like saying this to like
try to like sound tough or something.
I'm genuinely just built built
different. Like I'm used to this [ __ ]
Um I can handle it. I can like go live
and do [ __ ] after. But there's so many
people that like I I would never want
this to happen to someone else.
Most people would have just canceled
their show and went home probably. And I
don't think anyone would [ __ ] blame
them.
Yeah, I just I worry a lot for um small
creators,
not not even small creators, even
medium-sized creators who can't afford
one, two, three security guards
coming to [ __ ] like this. I I don't
know. Just be safe out there, guys. Try
to be smart. Um stick with your friends
in your group.
And uh
yeah, don't be afraid to talk or ask for
help
if you ever need stuff. And then as a
community, we need to stand up for each
other and look out for each other and
talk about things when things happen to
each other.
And uh the last thing that I want to say
is um I didn't really get a chance to
talk about it because of you know all
the things that were happening but
um I kind of wanted to apologize for
uh some people were talking about the
clip of me
getting kind of emotional at the end of
the RV trip. um
that [ __ ] kind of just slipped out. But
there's a lot of things that
I haven't wanted to talk about
that I think I will probably be talking
about uh when I get home from TwitchCon.
So, just want to let you guys know about
that.
Uh
yeah, thank you guys for the support.
And uh I should probably head over to
the getting ready area for the show
because I think that the other people in
the show are already they're getting
dressed. So I'm going to go talk to
them. So
uh Ally, if you could put on a BRB and
then soon there should be like a a show
starting soon thing. It'll be like 10
minutes or so and then um showtime.
But yeah, thank you guys. Uh thanks for
letting me rant about all of this.
Uh yep.
Love you guys.
And uh yeah, look out for each other.
I'll see you all in 10 minutes.
I'm gonna end this here and then we're
going to go to our BRB.
So hopefully some of you guys will watch
the show.
Bye.
