Open just dropped agent builder and the
internet is screaming rip at n but they
are not even playing the same game. I
spent the last 48 hours building
identical workflows on both platforms
and what I discovered will completely
change how you think about AI
automation. Now one platform it's built
for conversations the other one it's
built for automation and understanding
that difference it's everything. So let
me break it down for you. What's up
guys? My name is Nick and today we're
just going to be settling this debate
once and for all where I'm going to be
comparing OpenAI's brand new agent
builder against NN across six different
categories. So, we're talking about ease
of use, triggers, tools, AI models, user
interfaces, and deployment. So, by the
end of this video, you're going to know
exactly which platform is going to fit
your particular needs, whether you are a
complete beginner, a developer, or
running an agency. and stick around
because I'm going to share the one
mindset shift that matters more than any
tool that you will ever learn. So, let's
dive in. First, let's just level set.
OpenAI Agent Builder launched yesterday,
October 6th. Literally just dropped.
It's a drag and drop visual builder if
you're not familiar already. It's
designed specifically for creating
conversational AI agents. Now, Sam
Alman, he called it Canva for agents.
And honestly, that's pretty accurate.
Now, N8N, this has been around since
2019, but it exploded within the last
year or so. So, if we look at the Google
Trends chart, it absolutely hockey
sticks past Zapier and also Make.com.
Why? Well, because it's open- source. It
is infinitely flexible and it has over
500 integrations. And just the way that
you build things, it just makes sense.
But here is the critical distinction
that not many people are actually
talking about. So, agent builder, it is
designed for chat first workflows and
N8N, it is designed for automation first
workflows. One is a conversational tool,
the other is an automation engine. Now,
the difference, this changes everything.
So, let's get into the different
categories. So, category number one,
this is going to be the ease of use. So,
I'm going to be brutally honest here. If
you're brand new to AI automation, agent
builder, it's going to feel like a
breath of fresh air, but just watch
this. I am going to open agent builder.
I'm going to click create workflow. And
boom. I get a very clean canvas with a
start node. And beyond that, I am also
going to get an AI agent node. That's
it. On the left sidebar, we have 11
nodes total. The agent, end, file
search, guardrails, MCP servers, and
five logic operations. That's everything
that you are getting at least right now.
Now, if we jump into N, I create a new
workflow and okay, like this is
immediately more overwhelming. I've got
categories, subcategories, hundreds of
nodes to choose from. If you want to add
an agent, it's cool. But now I need to
connect a chat model, configure memory,
setup tools, and I'm already getting
errors because I forgot to link
something. Now, here is the test. I want
to build an AI agent that searches the
web and answers questions. In agent
builder, I click the agent. I'm then
going to click add tool, select web
search, and this is done. That's it.
There's no API keys, no setup. It's just
it just works. And NN I need to find the
right tool from hundreds of different
options. And then I need to connect it,
grab an API key for the search provider,
grab another API key for the chat model,
configure the connections and
everything. So, you get it. For a
complete beginner building their first
agent agent builder, it wins without a
doubt on pure simplicity. It's faster,
it's cleaner, it's less intimidating.
But here's the thing, that simplicity,
it comes with tradeoffs. So, let's talk
about them. By the way, if you guys are
getting any sort of value from this and
you just want to go deeper on AI
automation or learning how to sell or
make a business out of this, I've got a
free school community with almost 15,000
members who are all interested in AI
automation and building stuff just like
this. We do weekly calls, competitions,
we share free resources and free
templates and honestly just a great
place to network and learn. Link is in
the description. Go ahead and join. But
let's go ahead and just keep moving. So
category two, this is all about triggers
and automation. So this is where things
are getting a little bit more
interesting because this category it
reveals the fundamental difference
between these platforms. So in agent
builder you can look at this uh you know
the plus trigger and the options. So
you've got start. That's literally it.
Just one node called start. And notice
what it says when you create a workflow.
So just build a chat agent workflow. So
they're telling you exactly what this
is. It's a conversational agent that you
are talking to. The only way to trigger
this agent is by sending it a message
either through the chat interface or by
calling it through an API. There are no
scheduled triggers, no app events, no
web hooks that are going to be firing
when something happens in your CRM. And
if you want to build an agent that
automatically responds to Gmail
messages, well then you would just have
to build a separate system to watch
Gmail and then call this agent. It's not
designed for that. But if we're going to
jump into NN, what we do is we click the
trigger node and we look at what we get.
So, Gmail, there's like eight different
triggers, including um on message
received for uh we can open up Slack.
There's going to be eight different
triggers. Google Drive, you're going to
have multiple different triggers as
well. So, we have like web hooks, we
have schedules, database changes,
literally anything. I could build an
agent that can automatically run when a
lead is going to maybe be filling out a
form or when a customer sends an email
or when a Slack message just mentions a
keyword or on a schedule at 9:00 a.m.
every Monday. But here's why this
matters is because the most value
automations, they do not require human
intervention. They just run in the
background, saving time and scaling with
your business. And if you want an agent
that automatically nurtures leads and
processes invoices or monitors customer
support tickets, you need real triggers.
An agent builder, it does not have them.
It's built for you to have conversations
with, at least right now. And NN, it's
built to run autonomously in the
background. So two completely different
philosophies. Category 3, this is all
about agent tools and integrations. So
tools are essentially just what gives
your agent superpowers. So let's see
what each platform offers. Now in agent
builder I can click the add tool and
here is what I'm getting. I'm getting
web search which is builtin and works
great. File search for any documents
client tool which sends data to chat
widgets and the MCP servers. Now out of
the box agent builder only connects to
about eight different apps. I covered
this in my last video so feel free to go
check that out. So we have like Gmail,
Google Calendar, Drive, you know the
very basics. And that's useful for
simple stuff, but it's extremely limited
if you're trying to build something that
actually solves real problems. But
here's where it gets interesting, and
this is something that most people are
completely missing, is that you can
connect agent builds to over 500 apps,
all using something called Rube. So Rube
is essentially an MCP, you know, model,
context, protocol, if you're not
familiar with it already. And this is
just giving your agent access to over
500 apps and 50,000 different actions.
And we're talking about Slack, Notion,
Air Table, HubSpot, Salesforce, Stripe,
Basana, ClickUp, literally everything.
You connect it once through this MCP
server option and it works across all
your agents. Now, if you want to see
exactly like how to connect agent
builder to these 500 plus apps, all
using Rube, I actually made a full video
breaking down that step by step. So,
make sure to check out the proceeding
video. I literally just uploaded it
yesterday. But yeah, it's a game changer
for making agent builder actually useful
for real business workflows. And with
that MCP connection, agent builder, it
becomes way more powerful. But even with
Rube, there are still limitations. Now,
N8N, if we are to open the tools panel,
and yeah, over 500 native integrations
just built right in there. So, we have
Gmail, Slack, you get the idea. I'm not
going to name all them. If you can't
find what you need, you just use an HTTP
quest node. And with this single node,
like you can connect to any service that
has an API. That is thousands of
possibilities. But here's the real power
move in N8N is the subworkflows. So if
you watch this, I can build a
specialized email agent workflow with
its own tools and its logic. Then I can
call that entire agent as a tool from
another agent. So that means I can
create modular reusable agent systems.
Now an orchestrator agent that delegates
to specialist agents. So that is the
next level automation architecture and
when it is coming to really just using
tools and integrations both platforms it
can connect to a bunch of different apps
but N8N does it natively and with way
more flexibility through subflows and
HTTP requests. So the architecture
possibilities they are just deeper
inside of NAN. Category four this is all
about AI model support. So this one's
pretty straightforward but very
important. So agent builder, it gives
you access to all OpenAI models. That is
it. So we have GPT4, 40, all them, all
the reasoning models, everything from
OpenAI. And look, they're great models.
You can adjust reasoning effort,
verbosity, tool choice. It's all there.
And since you're in the OpenAI
ecosystem, there's zero setup, but
you're also locked in. Like you can't
use Claw, you can't use Gemini, you
can't use Llama or Mistrol or any of the
hundreds of other models out there. And
here's why that matters is because
different models they excel at different
tasks. So like Claude, it is pretty
exceptional at writing. Gemini excels at
code. GBT4 is great all around.
Sometimes you just want to choose the
best tool for the specific job. Also
what happens when OpenAI goes down and
it does go down. There's no backup. And
at N you're able to choose your fighter
like Enthropic or Google Azure Coher
whatever it may be. It's all natively
supported. Or you could just connect to
open router and lock literally hundreds
of models through one API. And you can
even use local models if you're
self-hosting N8N. There's zero external
dependencies, complete control, and you
still get all the configuration options
and temperature, top P, frequency,
everything. The model flexibility in NN,
it's a massive advantage. You're not
betting on one company. You're not
limited to one set of capabilities. You
can experiment, you can compare, and you
can use the best model for each specific
task. Now, that flexibility, it does
compound over time. Okay, this next
category, it's where OpenAI's agent
builder absolutely shines. And I mean
really shines because they release
something called chatkit alongside agent
builder. And it's honestly very
impressive. So, you can just watch this
in my agent. I'm going to change the
output format to widget. Now I can click
create widget and I am taken to the
widget studio. So look at this gallery.
There's pre-built interactive widgets
for scheduling, product recommendations,
data visualizations, forms. It's all
customizable. And if you don't see what
you want, then you can just click like
create new widget and literally describe
what you want and it's going to generate
a custom widget for you. And then there
is the playground beyond this. So the
playground I can customize the entire
chat interface. So like light mode, dark
mode, colors, typography, button styles,
brand, the whole thing, you know, the
whole the whole nine. And when I'm done,
I am going to get an embed code so we
could drop it on a website and boom,
professional chat interface ready to go.
And this is huge for anyone building
customerf facing agents or internal
tools because you go from idea to
deployed interface in literally minutes.
an N8N. Yeah, this is a bit rough, but
you get a basic chat interface when the
like when chat message received is being
triggered and it looks like this. It's
going to be functional, but it's very
bland. There's not as much
customization. There's no widgets.
There's no branding. So, if you want
something that looks professional,
you're going to be building a custom
front end. Now that means React or Vue
or whatever framework that you know or
just using like glovable or VO and you
can use NN as the backend brain but
you're coding the interface yourself and
that's not a dealbreaker for developers
or agencies because we do this all the
time but it's way more work now agent
builder UI capabilities they are
legitimately impressive for anyone who
needs a polished production ready chat
interface all without having to touch
code it's complete game changer. Final
category and this one is about ownership
and security. So agent builder, it is
deployed entirely on OpenAI's cloud. You
build it, you publish it, it lives on
their servers, and that's incredibly
convenient. There's zero infrastructure
to manage, no servers to maintain. It
just works. But OpenAI, they do have
complete control over your agents and
your data and everything. It's going to,
you know, it's going through their
systems. So for companies already deep
in OpenAI's ecosystem, this isn't a
problem. But for enterprises with strict
data restrictions, it's a non-starter.
Like N8N is open source. Well,
technically source available, but close
enough. Like you can host it in the
cloud, which is easiest, definitely
self-host on your own servers for full
control, or just run it locally on your
machine with zero external dependencies.
And this means that you own your data.
You control your infrastructure. You can
even use local AI models and keep
everything on premise. And before you
think like that sounds complicated, NN's
cloud does exist. It's fully managed
hosting just like OpenAI oneclick
deployment it's done. You get the
benefits without the DevOps headache and
the flexibility here it's unmatched
because and cost control through
self-hosting security through local
deployment or convenience through cloud
hosting like you choose agent builder
it's convenient but you're renting and
at N it gives you your ownership. So for
agencies like building client systems or
enterprises with compliance requirements
that ownership it seriously matters a
lot. Now, with all of this being said, I
just wanted to quickly mention that we
are running a 3-day AI agency challenge
where we literally walk you through
building your first automation, setting
up your offer, and getting your first
client. It's just $47. It's super
practical, no fluff. Links down below in
the description if you want in. We've
had people book in their first calls
with clients within the first week of
going through it. But, let's just get
back into it and finish this off. So,
before we actually wrap up, I need to
share something that is important than
any tool comparison. Now, the biggest
mistake that I see people make is
getting obsessed with tools. Like,
should I learn any or agent builder?
Even though it doesn't take much to
learn agent builder, but like what if I
pick the wrong one? What if something
better comes out? And here's what
matters. You need to learn to identify
where AI creates value. Businesses do
not hire you because you know N. They
hire you because you can save them 15
hours a week on email triage and cut
their lead response time from two hours
to two minutes or just automate their
invoicing process and save them $50,000
annually. The tool it's just a vehicle.
The value it's in understanding like
where is manual work creating
bottlenecks and where are humans doing
what AI should handle and what processes
should or would compound if automated.
So become tool agnostic, master the
thinking and learn the tools as it's
needed because here's what's going to
happen next month. Google will probably
release something 6 months from now.
Enthropic might drop their version and
new tools will keep coming. But the
ability to look at a business and say
here's where AI or these systems will
give you 10x return on investment. Like
that skill it never expires. So yes,
learn n learn agent builder or whatever
comes next. But more importantly, learn
to solve real problems. Learn to
identify any inefficiencies. Learn to
calculate ROI. And that is what actually
matters. The tools they will change. The
principles they will not. But that is
the entire breakdown. Agent Builder and
NN, they're both powerful. And Agent
Builder, it's only going to get more
powerful. You know, this initial
release, it does have bugs, but it is
the beta. But with that being said, like
one's more so built for conversations,
at least right now. The other one is
built for agents, anything agentic and
automations. So, choose based on your
specific need. And remember that if you
want to see how to connect agent builder
to 500 plus apps using Rube, then check
out my previous tutorial. But besides
that, thank you guys for watching. Drop
a comment and tell me which one are you
using, team agent builder or are you
team NN? And what kind of agents are you
building? But with that being said, if
this helped you at least just a little
bit, make sure to like, subscribe. It
genuinely helps the channel grow. And
with that being said, I will see you
guys in the next video.
