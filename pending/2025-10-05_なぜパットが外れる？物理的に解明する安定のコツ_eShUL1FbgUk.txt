Hello
This time, for the first time in a while,
I'd like to talk about
putting. I'm sure you all know the
importance of putting. Golf
is a game about reducing the number of
putting strokes you
need. Unless you hit the green in two on
a par 5 or in one on a par
4, you basically need 36 shots. Every
time you miss the green,
the number of shots increases to 37, 38,
39, and so on. However,
if you putt well, you can one-putt all 18
holes, or 18 putts.
This is not a dream. Your shots may be
off, but your putts may go
in like crazy, and you may get your best
score. Conversely,
your shots may be good, but your putts
may not go in at all,
resulting in a terrible score. The
essence of golf is to reduce
the number of putts you make. To achieve
this, you need to decide
where to hit your shots. No matter how
aggressive your shots
are, if your putts don't go in, your
score won't improve. I'm
sure you all know this, but I'd like to
share two methods that
will make it easier for the ball to go
where you aim.
First, when taking back, the right hip
joint
Step back and let your head sink
This is what happens to so many people.
The reason is that if the
position of your head drops when you pull
the head from the address,
you will be able to use the weight of the
club to take back.
Can be pulled smoothly
When you want to hit the ball with a
stroke that requires as
little use of your hands as possible,
pull the back
Head gets closer to the ball
With this movement, when you pull back on
the backswing, you
can pull it smoothly without using any
force, but the problem
comes from the transition to impact, when
you have to lift up
what has dropped down. Putting is
basically a pendulum motion,
so if you go down on the backswing, you
have to lift it up.
Furthermore, looking at putting data, it
seems that hitting
on a slightly upward trajectory will
result in a good roll.
You want to pull the head low and long on
the backswing, and you
want to pull it without using any force,
so pull it as your head
approaches the ball, then lift it up and
hit it. If you do this,
the impact will be weaker, and you will
be more likely to miss
putts by hitting it to the right.
Therefore, when you pull back
on the backswing, try not to drop the
position of your right
hip, but rather imagine that your right
side is lifting up. If
you can pull back with the feeling that
you are lifting up a
little, then you can relax from this
point and
the head will come down in a pendulum
motion.
By the force of gravity
The head moves at a consistent rhythm as
it comes down.
If you try to pull it up, the rhythm will
change depending
on your strength. So, instead of lowering
yourself
with a firm backswing, try to pull it
down with the image
of lifting it up. If you putt with this
feeling, you may
be able to hit strokes at a consistent
rhythm.
The next thing you need to be aware of is
that from impact
to follow-through, your head should move
towards your heels.
Pull back and hit
This is also a common occurrence. The
reason this happens is that,
as mentioned earlier, if you step back
during the backswing, you
don't have to use as much force. For the
same reason, if you step back during the
downswing,
The head moves naturally, without the
need for force.
It comes down smoothly. It's surprisingly
easy to do
naturally, so if you're not careful,
after pulling it
On the downswing, the buttocks leave the
ball
If you hit the ball while moving
backwards, please take a video from
behind
and you will see that if you are hitting
the ball while your hips or head are
extremely low, this is something you need
to be careful of.
This correction method is to
Where is the force and centre of gravity?
I think the arch of the foot
is good, but the weight in front and
behind this doesn't change until
you hit the ball through. Make sure your
weight is not on your heels as
you head towards impact. Instead of
concentrating on the movement
of the head, make sure you are conscious
of where your centre of gravity
is when you stroke. In this take-back,
your right hip moves towards
your buttocks while your head drops, and
then on the downswing your
whole body moves towards your heels. If
you hit the ball naturally
without putting force into these two
physical sensations, swinging
like this will simplify the movement of
the head; it will be easier to
do this. The head movement feels
smoother, so it tends to
happen unconsciously without you
realising it.
However, extreme head movements before
and after
Every time you hit a moving shot, it
becomes uncertain where it will
hit. And because the energy you intended
to hit with this strength is
transmitted differently, you might think
you've hit it steadily but
it ends up being a meter short, or the
next time you hit it, for some reason
it might go over by a meter. Your sense
of distance becomes unstable,
and this can cause you to lose confidence
in your putting. Please keep
these two points in mind when practicing
putting, and during your
round, instead of just watching what your
fellow players are doing,
try checking your own stroke, the
movement you want to make, and play
the round. If you have trouble getting
the sense of distance right when
putting, or are worried about short
putts, this may be of great benefit
to you. And just to chat a little later,
the Bay Current Tour starts next
week at Yokohama Country Club. Pro
Konishi, who I teach here, has been
selected to participate. The strict
requirement is that he must be
within the top 9 in the prize money
rankings at the end of the Tokai Classic
to be able to participate, but he has
firmly made it into the rankings
and will be competing on his first
American tour. This is very moving
for me, and three years ago when I asked
him to teach me this, he didn't
even have a prize money seed. I am very
happy that he has been able to play
on the American tour with his own ability
and prize money. He still has
a lot to do and his skills are not yet at
their peak, but as long as he is a
professional golfer, he is working hard
with the dream of playing in
the Masters. I would like to continue to
provide him with good guidance
so that he can continue to do even better
and do his best. If
