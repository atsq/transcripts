If you're a small business owner or a
soul trader, there's a good chance
you're doing at least three things right
now that could trigger ATO order. And
the worst part, you probably don't even
know you're doing them. I'm Dave Mack, a
chartered accountant. And after working
with hundreds of businesses over the
years, I've seen the same patterns over
and over again. The businesses that get
audited aren't necessarily the ones
doing anything dodgy. They're often just
the ones making predictable mistakes.
Today, I'm going to show you the biggest
audit triggers and more importantly
exactly what you need to do to stay out
of the ATO's radar. Let me start by
saying the ATO's audits aren't random.
They use sophisticated data matching and
analytics to identify businesses that
look suspicious. And with that extra $1
billion in funding this financial year,
they getting even better at this. The
ATO has access to data from banks,
payment platforms, crypto exchanges,
property transactions, insurance
companies, and even your social media.
They cross-checking with everything
against what you've reported. So, if
there is a mismatch between your
lifestyle and your declared income, or
if your business metrics look unusual
compared to similar businesses, you're
going to get their attention. Since July
2019, the ATO's received over 250,000
tip offs about tax avoidance and other
dishonest behaviors. They actually
receive almost 1,000 tip offs every
single week. And about 90% of these are
analyzed and deemed to require further
review or audit by the ATO. I can't say
for certain how many audits are result
of these tip offs, but being an
accountant for over 18 years tells me
that this can be a big factor in why
you've been chosen as an audit. With
that said, let me walk you through the
six most common things that triggers an
audit because once you know what they're
looking for, you can avoid these traps.
Number one, late or missing lodgements.
This is a big one. The AT explicitly
warns that avoiding or delaying
lodgements will attract our attention.
If you're consistently late with your
tax returns or business activity
statements, you're basically sending a
red flag straight to the ATO. Even if
your cash flow issues are causing you
problems, it's better to lodge on time
and work out a payment plan than lodge
late. The ATO sees late lodgement as a
sign of poor recordkeeping and potential
non-compliance. Number two, unreported
or mismatched income. As I've already
mentioned, the ATO's data matching
systems are incredibly sophisticated.
They cross-check your reported income
against information from the banks,
employers, payment platforms, and other
sources. If you're earning money through
gig economy platforms like Uber or
Airbnb or cryptocurrency trading or even
side freelance work, the ATO probably
already has that data matched.
Forgetting to declare this income is one
of the most common audit triggers.
Number three, inflated or unusual
deductions. This is where a lot of
business owners get into trouble. The
ATO analyzes industry averages and
compares your deductions to similar
businesses. If you're claiming much
higher deductions than what's normal for
your type of business, you're going to
attract scrutiny. The classic mistakes I
see are claiming 100% of your car as
business expenses when you clearly use
it personally, writing off family
holidays as business travel, and
claiming your entire home internet and
phone bills as business expenses. The
rule is simple. If you can't prove it's
generally business related, don't claim
it. Number four, consistent losses. It's
normal for a startup to make a loss in
first year or two. But if you're
reporting losses year after year, the
ATO will start questioning whether you
are running a genuine business or just a
hobby designed to claim tax deductions.
The ATO generally views three loss years
out of the five as a pattern that
indicates a red flag. If you're
consistently in the red, you need to be
able to demonstrate that you're
genuinely trying to make profit. Number
five, cash heavy businesses. If your
business operates largely in cash,
you're automatically in a high risk
category. The ATO closely watches
industries where cash sales are common,
like hospitality, trades, booty salons,
and retail shops. They might compare
your reported sales against industry
benchmarks, or even check your supplies
records to estimate if cash might be
missing. If you accept cash payments,
you need to be diligent about recording
every transaction. And number six, out
of line industry performance. As I've
already mentioned, the ATO uses small
business benchmarks as a health check.
So they compare your financial ratios
like cost of goods sold, profit margins,
and expense P percentages against others
in your industry. If your numbers are
way outside the normal range, it
suggested something might be wrong. For
example, if most cafe businesses spend
30% of turnover on wages and you claim
60%. They're going to take a closer
look. You can check out the ATO small
business benchmarks here. So, how do you
stay off their radar? Your first line of
defense is maintaining detailed
financial records of all income and
expenses. Keep invoices, keep receipts,
bank statements, and log books for any
vehicle or home office use. The law
requires you to keep these records for
at least 5 years, but more importantly,
you need to be able to quickly produce
evidence for every figure on your tax
return. Then make sure every dollar of
your income is accounted for. This
includes cash sales, online earnings,
freelance work, cryptocurrency profits,
and sharing economy income. Everything.
Thanks to their data matching, the ATO
can see most of these income streams.
Anyway, the third thing you can do is
before claiming any expenses, ask
yourself if it's truly business related
and if you have proper evidence to
support it. Be particularly careful with
vehicle expenses, home office expenses,
travel expenses, and entertainment.
Next, make sure you consistently meet
all lodgement deadlines. Set reminders
or use a tax agent who can get extended
deadlines. Even if you can't pay
immediately, still lodge on time and
arrange a payment plan. Another thing
you can do is get familiar with the
typical financial ratios in your
industry. The ATO publishes small
business benchmarks. Use these as a
guide. If you're a significant outlier,
make sure you can explain why. If you
operate cash heavy business, implement
strong controls. Use cash registers that
provide daily totals. Bank your cash
regularly. And never keep two sets of
books. Always issue receipts and
maintain a complete transparency in your
recordeping. And lastly, make sure
you're meeting all your tax obligations.
Don't forget about GST, superanuation,
PY withholding, and other requirements.
A lot of the audits start with one issue
and expand when they find other
problems. Pay your employees super on
time. With modern reporting, the ATO is
immediately alerted to unpaid super and
it's a common trigger for broader
audits. If the ATO does contact you,
don't panic. Often, they just want
clarification or additional information.
Respond promptly and honestly, and get
professional help if needed. The worst
thing you can do is ignore their
correspondence. That's when simple
queries turn into fullblown audits.
Look, the reality is that the AT audits
are becoming more common and more
sophisticated. But if you're doing the
right thing, keeping proper records, and
following these guidelines, you
shouldn't have anything to worry about.
The key is being proactive rather than
reactive. Don't wait until you get that
letter from the ATO to sort out your
compliance. I'll see you guys next time.
