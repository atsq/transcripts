All right, I'm going to level with you
about hitting the ball very far. On this
channel, the way I teach you to create
swing speed and hit the ball consistent
is using a concept called weight
forward. Keeping the weight forward in
the swing maximizes power and allows you
to have the same contact point time and
time again. It's the key to playing
great golf. Well, when I learned the
golf swing, I learned to shift my weight
back and forth. This caused me to have
inconsistent contact and also rob me of
swing speed. And if you're like me and
you learned weight shift as a means of
executing power in the golf swing, well,
you may be struggling to access the
distance you really deserve. And that's
why I've got two very special guests on
today's show. Wes Patterson is a long
drive champion who currently utilizes a
weight forward technique, hit the ball
far. And I've got his coach, Mike
Manavian, to show you how it's done at
the highest level of ball striking.
>> Thanks, Tom, for having us on your
channel today. We are with the current
ultimate long drive champion for the 35
and over age bracket. Congratulations on
that.
>> Yeah,
>> Wes and I, we started working when
started working
>> April 23. Yeah,
>> it's about a year and a half now.
>> Yeah. So, you're coming off a few
injuries and we got together so you
could, you know, play some competitive
golf, amateur competitive golf, as well
as your professional longrad stuff. So,
>> so you're going to do a little
demonstration for us today on uh on the
sim here. So, we got foresight quad
running, we got gears running, you're
suited up uh 3D avatar stuff, and Tom's
got a few questions. We're going to go
straight into it. Why don't you Why
don't you go ahead and hit one for us?
>> Straight out the gate.
Got to get loose.
>> Yep. We'll hit a few here.
>> Got to get loose.
>> Got to get loose. And he's starting off
with 130 mph club head speed. Ball speed
is 191.
That's a beautiful high push draw there.
So, pretty flat trajectory. Club head
speed was 130 on that. We actually have
to move do a thing with Wes and put him
in the parking lot here. So,
um, he runs out of fairway on our on our
simulator. So, go for it.
>> Those are the misses, which are fine.
They're in play.
I think those are the uh
get too far back on my back foot. Let's
put a little bit more weight.
>> Yeah. So, in this one, I want you to put
all your weight on your front foot.
>> Yeah. What percentage of your weight
would you say your lower body is on your
front foot there?
>> Say about 80 at least.
>> Okay.
>> All right. Smash it. Keep it 80 there.
>> How was that one?
>> Nice. All
right, Wes. So, we got a couple
questions here to answer.
>> Wes, what are some of the big benefits
you've seen from using weight forward in
your swing? And how has it changed the
way you swing the club?
>> Well, that's pretty simple. It's It's
definitely made my bottom point more
consistent. Yeah.
>> Um especially with a longer driver, long
drive. I got a 40in club, it's hard
delivered the same way every time. So
being able to incorporate having guess
more stack and tilt right into the left
side and be able to deliver that club
the right at the low point just about
consistently as possible. That'll take
away a lot of my misses and be able to
be more dialed in on the shot that I
know I need to hit and what I'm
consistently hitting. Thought process is
clean things up so I don't have to
overthink. Now I know a shot pattern I'm
going to hit consistent low point. So
especially in long drive I know I'm
going to hit something right to left so
I can take an aim towards the right side
of the grid. Nice. Go ahead and
demonstrate one with your weight
forward.
>> It's definitely helped
consistent low point
like that almost.
>> Yeah.
>> That's hammered.
>> Yeah. So 194
>> 194 ball speed in the grid in play in a
fairway at 350 carry 370
>> 194 launch angle 106 carry 346
total 369 spin axis to the left offline
20 yards. Nice job.
>> This question is for Wes. Did you notice
a significant improvement or decrease in
distance after implementing weight
forward in your swing?
>> Increased speed. I mean, there's that's
kind of a um double-headed sword there.
So, we're we're we're delivering the
club at the same low point every time.
So, we're hitting the ball
>> more center
>> more center every time. So, the answer
is yes, ball speed's going up cuz I'm
hitting the more center. Um but also
being more efficient on using these
clubs. So, once we get these things
dialed in, we're letting the club do
most of the work as well. So, yes,
speed has gone up and distance is going
up.
>> Beautiful. Why don't you hit a shot for
us?
That was hammered.
Nice one there. It's always fun to see a
191 mph ball speed flicked out there at
376.
>> Since you teach professional golfers,
Mike, and Wes, you compete
professionally, what are some big
misconceptions that pro golfers have
surrounding weight forward?
So I love I love discussing this topic
obviously being a stack and tilt
authorized instructor and and um Wes
being one of my favorite students to
work with. So one of the things about uh
the weight forward people that
misinterpret it is the two centers they
think both centers have to be forward in
stack and tilt the weight forward is
only with the lower body. So by putting
our pelvis forward that creates our
secondary axis tilt with the driver. our
spine is tilted back versus trying to
achieve that secondary axis by tilting
the spine back in the down swing. So by
having all your weight forward at your
lower body, not the upper body, the
lower body, you'll be able to hit drives
higher to start with because you're
adding launch angle to that
>> and adding more consistent low point.
>> Agreed. So to get to that low point, why
don't you hit one for us where you put
all the weight of your pelvis forward.
Really exaggerate this one.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Go for it. So we can set up
>> so a little bit forward and
>> just like that. Yeah.
>> Still have your lower upper body and
it's perfect.
>> That ball drew, didn't it?
>> Yeah. 194.
>> So that was the highest ball speed so
far. 194
with the weight the most forward. How
much weight forward would you say that
was?
>> I mean I would say at least 80 85% on
the left side. So, if we pull up the
gears data here from above, Wes, I'd say
that your pelvis is a lot closer to your
lead foot here than it is to your trail
foot. Agree? So, we can see it here at
the setup. Pelvis is a lot more forward
and your spine is still in the middle of
your body, your upper part of your your
upper axis in the in the front part. So,
as you make a back swing, your head's
staying centered. The lower body is
going forward one inch, 1.2 in. And as
you come through impact, all the
weight's staying forward. So you got a
one inch hip slide because all your
weight was forward to start with.
>> And you've created that secondary axis
tilt to launch this thing up in the air.
So the ball data here shows that you
swung two degrees into out, three
degrees up, face to path was closed,
just a little bit over 50%. And you have
a 131 mile per hour club head speed,
pretty well centered. And now if we were
to really have some fun and for the
ground force reaction people, we can
start pointing out
where the where the pressure is as he's
going back.
All the weight's forward. Pressure's
forward.
>> Very good.
>> You want to try to like really shift the
weight and forward and Yeah. back and
forth.
>> Yeah. Do the opposite of it.
>> I mean, I might shake this one, but
we're
>> I'll stand over here. Make sure we're
clear. Back
>> and
That wasn't very good.
>> That ball sliced off to the right.
>> Speed went down. Spin was way up.
>> So, you just went from 386 yards
>> to 325 with a big banana slice to the
right. 187 mph. And then when we look at
the gears data, you hit it low in the
heel. Tough to control your low point.
We can put these two up side by side. So
the gold one is the swing you just made
with the weight shifting way to the
right early and yet you swung slower.
So a lot of people like to talk about
this P2 point here where you've got all
the this interesting where the blue
arrows going the opposite direction. So
you're actually pushing off the front
too much to move to the trail side where
the other one you were pushing off the
trail side moving to the front. Your
head's more centered now. Your pelvis
doesn't have to reenter at the top on in
the blue guy from before. So instead of
being two inches away, you're one inch
forward.
And that's a significant change in
location of your pelvis. Never mind
where you got to hit the golf ball.
>> So at impact,
>> you're tilted back.
I mean, the low point of your control is
totally in a different spot in the club
face. So
>> riddle me this. Yeah.
>> On the very beginning of that, you
showed that when I had to really shift
that weight back, I was actually moving
>> the other way. Yeah.
>> Right.
>> Forward. So,
you know, there's a little bit bump
there, right? But there's be able to
push back here. You're using a lot of
weight to push off your front side.
Like, so what what what would they were
losing effort going this way,
>> right? So, as you were straightening
your right leg, you were pushing
forward.
>> As you were shifting to the trail side,
you were pushing off your lead leg going
back. Now, the center point moves too
far back. So, and you also swung slower
and less efficiently. You didn't hit it
as far.
>> Yeah.
>> So, interesting. So, let's uh listen to
the next question.
>> Given that weight forward is a new
concept to a lot of golfers, how would
you recommend that someone goes about
approaching using weight forward in
their swing for the first time,
especially with the driver?
>> So, with the driver, as I said before,
the weight forward is really the pelvis
being forward versus the upper axis
being forward. So I would just start by
um Wes if you want to hit a few shots
first just kind of with the driver low
the thrust rate kind of go from P3 left
arm parallel to P9 right arm parallel
just chip a few drivers out there at
this at a low speed not going full you
can actually get a little bit more on
the tip toe of the foot. Yeah. So you're
going to change your knee flex as you go
back keeping your weight forward
just so you can start getting some low
point control there.
>> Just chipping it out there. That would
be how I would start that.
>> All right. This question is for both of
you. So, Wes, what was your swing like
before working with Mike? And what kind
of progress have you seen now that you
have been working with him for a little
while?
>> I don't want to give old Mike too much
credit, but I was pretty lost before I
met you. Um, I was lucky enough to be
athletic enough to get away with have
good hands being an athlete from from my
whole career. I've been able to get
>> Hall of Fame baseball player for your
college, right? played multiple sports.
But no, let's go back to I was stuck in
the whole X factor. Let's uh let's get
some big turns. Hips opens up way early
and and try to create lag. But I I could
save it because I had good enough hands
and I could play good enough golf and
also I can miss greens and get upside up
up and down. So it was I would go down
that process of like how much we can get
our hips open before our arms get down
and I would get stuck and I would hit
big hooks. But when I could time it
well, I hit it far. I hit it well, but I
was athletic enough to be able to do it.
And but I was inconsistent as can be.
And I obviously trying to play the same
high level before I got into long drive.
I was those inconsistencies were more a
little bit less then before I got into
long drive cuz I was swinging a little
bit slower. But also looking back on it
now when I was playing at high level is
I was still too inconsistent. So once we
got together and started learning a
little bit more how the body works
properly creates a consistent low point
and when you can have a consistent low
point the same way every time and it
makes this go a lot easier.
>> So the first fundamental making sure you
can control the low point.
>> Um second fundamental will be power.
Making sure you can hit far enough to
play the golf course with scoring clubs.
You've never had a problem with speed
>> but dialing in that third fundamental
having a predictable curve kind of goes
with the first fundamental controlling
your low point. Hey, I like to hit on
that because I've always hit a far in my
life and everything swing fast.
Everybody's always talking about you
need to hit a cut, hit a cut, hit a cut,
hit a cut, hit a fade. And um you know
what we've learned and what we've worked
on is when I'm the best consistent is
when I'm hitting a a little push fall uh
push draw or even like a tad of a pull.
>> Yeah.
>> Um and especially in long drive, that's
my best flight is a pull. Um that's when
I'm at my best is But it's uh it's
interesting to hear people with speed.
you got to hit a fade, but realistically
you can control a draw at our distances
as well.
>> Indeed.
>> And Mike, how have you seen Wes's swing
change in terms of speed and other long
drive type metrics?
>> So,
the biggest change I've seen in your
swing is also to controlling your low
point. you're not um especially in your
social golf or even your competitive
amateur golf. Um you're you're getting
rid of the out- of- bounces the which
really ruin your stroke scanned average.
Um getting you to be a a strong hitter
but to actually you know hit threewoods
in play, hit four irons in play off the
tee so you can have wedges into the
greens when you have a 300 yard hole. I
think what your third hole or your
second hole at your course?
>> Second hole. Second hole is a 300 yard
hole and you hit a six iron off that tee
and put a wedge on the green versus
normally when you hit a 3-wood and just
smoke it into the water, you know. So
having those types of shots where you're
just kind of playing the game from a
strongman standpoint or a long drive
standpoint, but using the short irons to
to chip it around the course so when you
get to a long course you you have no
issues with it.
>> Yeah. And also the fact of you know with
distance as well like I can hit a 9 iron
177 that's my club to most people that's
a seven or six out there. So that's my
advantage is I don't have to get that
that length advantage off the TE. It can
be the second shot. It can be the third
shot. It can be all that good stuff. So
>> yeah, we've my game has changed a lot
>> for the better.
>> Hurt me. It's hurt me in gambling not to
give up a lot of shots now, but it's
it's definitely gotten good.
>> Fair enough. Why don't you smash one for
us?
>> Nice.
196 miles per hour. That's fine.
goes 350.
>> Yeah, I think we're done.
