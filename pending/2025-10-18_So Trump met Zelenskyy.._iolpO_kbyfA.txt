Thank you very much, Mr. President.

>> very good. And I think it looks
beautiful in his jacket. It's beautiful.
>> Wow.
>> People notice it's a good It's actually
very stylish. I like it.
>> Every time, bro. Every time he wore a
suit again.
>> I bet he did.
>> Yep, we can.
>> Yep.
Hey, hey, hey. President, are you going
to end the war? Yeah.
>> Any other questions?
>> Yep.
>> Yeah, we can. Okay, great. And uh yeah,
shoes, I guess. So, I mean, not a tall
guy, right? I mean, but that's the way
it is. And uh let's see if I can find
it. I bother agreed Zalinski. I have no
idea what the [ __ ] this is. So, what did
he say? Um, even Botox couldn't hide JD
Vance's emotions.
Is JD Vance mad about this? Wait, what?
And
I'm trying to even find out like, yeah,
>> this came up yesterday. A tunnel
>> from Russia to Alaska. That's
interesting. What do you think of that,
Mr. President? Do you have any ideas?
How do you like that idea?
[Music]
Bro.
>> Bro, really?
>> I'm not happy with this.
>> I don't think he
>> I'm not happy with it.
>> I don't think he liked it. I don't think
he liked it.
>> President Trump, do you think that?
>> I'm not happy with it.
>> This came up yesterday. a tunnel from
Russia to Alaska. He's definitely rage
baiting against Mr. President. Do you
have any
>> Well, and and here's the reason why
Trump does this, by the way. So, there's
actually a reason why Trump does this
with people is that he does this to test
them to see how they're going to handle
stressful situations. And this is
something that any guy in any modern
warfare 2 lobby. It's just that the
problem is that Trump treats a modern
Trump treats the lobby room in the White
House like a Modern Warfare 2 lobby. And
so he he's [ __ ] testing people and
[ __ ] putting them on the spot with
these questions, but it's in front of
the entire world.
I men test each other. Yes. How you like
it?
>> I'm not happy with this.
>> I don't think you're going to like it.
Right.
>> I don't think he liked it. I don't.
>> Yeah. And Trump doesn't bother him and
he said that. He says, "I don't like
it." He's like, "All right." You know,
there it is. Okay. Let's see if there's
another one.
>> The difference in diplomacy between
President Trump and President Joe Biden
before him. What do you see as the
biggest difference in diplomacy between
President Trump and President Biden?
President Trump
has a big chance now to finish this war.
President Biden now is not a president.
So he doesn't have a chance to finish
this war. And President Trump is really
>> he trying he trying to be political
about it.
>> Showed
for the wall that he I mean to be fair
if you think about what he's saying the
logic is accurate.
manage ceasefire in Middle East and
that's why I hope that he will do this
and we will also have such big success
for Ukraine.
>> It's a big chance
>> and I hope that President Trump can
manage it.
>> I I would I would say the biggest
difference is
>> the biggest difference is that I'm great
and he's a [ __ ] Right. Is
>> extremely competent and the other one is
grossly incompetent.
How about that?
>> That's crazy, right? Yeah. Wow. Who
could have predicted that? Bro won the
election. He's still going on about it.
After he wins the third election, he
probably still sorry, the four after he
wins the fourth election, he's probably
still going to be going going on about
it. to authorize CIA operations in
Venezuela as part of
>> Well, I wouldn't say that, but uh some
interesting things are happening around
the world. I'll say that.
>> Mr. President, it has been reported that
Maduro offered everything in it in his
country, all the natural resources. He
even recorded a message to you in
English recently uh offering mediation.
What could we do? So he offered all of
his resources and an English message to
Donald Trump specifically.
>> He's offered everything. He's offered
everything. You're right. You know why?
Because he doesn't want to [ __ ] around
with the United States. Thank you
everybody.

And that's the end of it.
Wow. He just says it.
Okay. Thank you everybody.
Wow.

But uh
>> I'm telling you guys like that Iran
thing really went farther than people
thought it did.
Like that [ __ ] Like whenever whenever
Trump came out and said, "Oh, yeah. By
the way, we blew all their [ __ ] up."
Yeah. You didn't know about it? Yeah, I
know. We know that. Yeah. Everything's
destroyed. All things. Yeah.
Everything's destroyed. All of them.
Yeah. Know we blew them all up.

around the world. I'll say that.

Maduro offered everything in it in his
country all just offered the whole
thing.

English recently uh offering mediation.
>> What could we do in order to stop that?

everything. You're right. You know why?
Because he doesn't want to [ __ ] around
with the United States. Thank you
everybody.

thing. I will play I will play that same
[ __ ] clip. Favorite President Trump
story. I'm going to give you my favorite
Trump my favorite President Trump story.
This is my number one favorite of all
time. when we were negotiating with the
Taliban while President Trump was still
the president.
>> Um, President Trump wanted to get out of
Afghanistan, but he wanted a
conditionsbased withdrawal,
>> meaning that you do what we tell you to
do and then we will start pulling troops
back slowly as long as you abide by our
rules.
>> And you have to remember this was not in
front of a camera. This wasn't like just
for show or whatever. No, this is
>> it's President Trump, Mike and Mike
Pompeo and they are talking to Taliban
leadership in the room. And they had one
translator in the room. President Trump
looked at at the Taliban leader and said
this,
I want to leave Afghanistan,
but it's going to be a conditionsbased
withdrawal. And translator translated
and he said, if you harm a a hair on a
single American, I'm going to kill you.
And the translator goes
and Trump goes, "Tell him
what tell him what I said." Reached in
his pocket, pulled out a satellite photo
of the leader leader of the of the
Taliban's home and handed it to him.
>> Shut up.
>> Got up and walked out the room,
>> man.
Oh man. It's about saying [ __ ] you.
Yeah, exactly. doesn't beat around the
bush. Yeah. And this is the thing,
right? I mean, like that's and and even
at the end of it, by the way, nothing
ever happened after that. That was it.
Like, uh, apparently they they didn't
attack anybody else or cause any more
[ __ ] problems after that. That's some
Zakario. Yeah. I mean, he speaks their
language. Yeah, they get it. And, uh,
it's weird, huh? Yeah. Wow. That's I
wonder why that [ __ ] happens. Damn. And
so, let's see what the comments are on
this. Wh what what is this? What are
people saying about this clip?
Yeah,
that's about right, huh?
That's really just about right. And uh
wow, Americans are cooked. I mean, I
don't know about that. I I wouldn't say
that. That's not what I would say, but

might say. And uh wow, damn. He's iced
out, bro. Like it's just
the one two man. It really is crazy. And

assertion that diplomacy itself is
irrelevant.

surprise. And uh yeah, it says so much
about the personalities. I love it. Yep.
There it is. J D Vance loves this [ __ ]

Christian rhetoric pisses me off,
though. I mean, I'm not about any of the
religious stuff, okay? Like, I'm not
trying to get We're not trying to get
involved in another [ __ ] crusade,
okay? We already did that. We did that
as a huge waste of [ __ ] money and I
don't need to do it again. They think
that international law matters. Yeah.
It's like, who enforces international
law? We do. Who the [ __ ] else is going
to do it? So, there it is. And uh yeah,
he's up on Mr. President, why are you up
on the roof? I want to look around.
Uh-huh. Right. No, no doubt. And uh
yeah, I guess there it is. And I'll see
if there's any more of these posts here

of this [ __ ] Jesus Christ. People

said no more endless wars, he meant I'll
end them. Well, yeah. I mean, that's
really it's that simple. People didn't

self-described crusader. Yeah, he is.
But, you know, like, you know, he not
going on all the crusades. It's just a
just a a little one, right? A couple
little ones and then it's over. So, it's
