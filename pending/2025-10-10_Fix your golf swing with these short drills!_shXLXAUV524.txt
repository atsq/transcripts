Hi, I'm George. Uh,
we made a little compilation of uh
videos this time. Uh, there are nine
videos and I wanted to make a little
introduction explaining you a little bit
um what was the the sub the the the
topic we were talking about in those
videos. Uh the first video uh explains
the hand path. How the hands are
orbiting around our spine.
Address. Good. Put your right fist under
the left arm. The right one under the
left. Good. Now raise it up.
Good. You see where it goes? It goes
behind you
with the left shoulder down. With the
left shoulder down. Good. You can use
your right hand. Good. And now I want
you to fire the left arm.
Where does it go?
It goes behind you. Because when we hit
a golf ball, when we hit the golf ball,
we are moving forward to the ball and to
the left.
And you are hitting me up and to the
right.
And we are hitting down and to the left
because this is where your left arm
would go.
But you don't let it go there because
you only use your right hand and you use
your your your belly
to push me the ball up like this.
And I want that you start using that
left arm to pull me the club around you.
Now try that again.
The second video explains that in a golf
swing uh width is depth. So with more
depth I get in my in my hand path as
wider as my swing. Imagine we would not
play golf with the ball on the ground.
Imagine we will play golf with a super
high te
super high and the ball would be here
there and we will play golf straight
because we don't play golf straight
because the ball is on the ground you
know that is why we we we bend forward
because the ball is on the ground. If
the ball would be here we would stay
straight.
Now you are the coach
and I believe that you would tell me to
hit that ball hard. If I do this here,
here
I could hit the hardest in the ball. No.
Or would you suggest me to do this here?
The first one. No. Good. So you would
suggest me and tell me
student.
Good. Put put your hands get me your
hands and your club the most behind you
you can. No. Then you could hit harder
in the ball. Good. Now look. I'm going
to do that. I'm going to listen to you.
And now I we said okay but golf we play
with the ball on the ground. No. And we
have to be laterally bent, don't we?
Like this.
This is where I can hit my ball
where my hands are the fastest because
my hands have traveled the most behind
me. In the third video, we talk about
the importance of moving our hands
or our hand path to the left when we
exit the club.
Good.
Yeah, you hold that one. Good. Now
listen.
Now let's see. We do not hit
like this,
but
we hit around.
Nice. Do that again.
Good. And again. Come on.
Great. Now do me that with the ball.
Oh. Oh,
that was pretty good. That That was
pretty good.
We have in the fourth video, the topic
was about keeping stable legs and stable
hips, not moving them during our potting
stroke. uh in order to to achieve a a
consistent impact uh when we part when I
part
look at my knees and look at my hips how
much do they move
zero
they don't actually they don't move
nothing okay so I have to find a
position an address position where my
legs are pressing in the
You remember before they decide to
jumping on the box?
Yeah.
How would you jump on a box? Like this?
No. Of course.
No. No. You would go in. You would.
Exactly. You would press in the ground.
Push your butt a little bit behind.
Good. And we going to stay here like
that. So, we start learning to purely
move our shoulders back and forth. Let's
show me that. Uh the fifth video talks
about rhythm which is one of the major
key points in in in short game.
Remember the ball will not move away. It
will stay there. It will wait for you.
There is no no need to I hit it. No no
no it's no need. It's it's going to wait
for you. Now you can go up here and you
can stop and you can think okay now
speed up. And you speed up. Okay. It
will stay there.
[Music]
Nice. Good. Now do me that.
Very nice.
Uh the next video
is a little bit a general explanation
that if you want to start playing golf,
you you have to to build up your swing
in in slow steps.
understanding a little bit uh having a
general understanding of the geometry of
the swing and then building up slowly.
We cannot start staying in front of the
ball and just hitting the ball as hard
as we can.
Nice. Wow, that's a nice ball. Good.
Now listen, this is a little bit how you
have to build up.
Mhm.
You understand? Because that shot you
just made there is already a decent
ball.
Okay? There are a lot of guys they never
hit the ball as long as that was a seven
iron making full I promise you making
full swings you understand we do not
have to hit so hard in the ball
basically because we have so many golf
clubs
so if I cannot reach it with my six iron
I take my five iron
okay so it's it's not about how hard I
can hitting the ball no it's about how
good I can hitting the ball
and how straight I can hit it okay good
and that doesn't mean that I don't want
you to hit me 200 yard with a seven eye
or no I'm happy like
As long as the ball goes where you want.
Okay.
The next video is just a simple
explanation about the arc of the swing.
You can move the water bottle like this.
Huh? You can move the water bottle like
this.
This is the circle. Look. This is the
circle.
No, not not this one. But this is how
you hitting the ball.
This one underneath your spine.
No, you're hitting me like that. You
even with a water bottle, you're hitting
me like that.
Even with the water bottle, you hit me
like that.
Good.
That one is not so good anymore.
There.
But you will have to do a little bit,
you know, you will have to put the water
bottle a bit behind you to
that would be great. Yes, that would be
great. The next video is uh
rhythm. Uh this is key point again in
the short game and also in the long
game. And I have to
thank all the support we got on
Instagram because this video had over
1.1 million views. So I'm I'm really
flattered that people liked so so much
watching that video.
Throw me the ball.
Good.
Good.
Thanks. Throw me another one.
When you throw it,
you stop here. You give yourself time
and then you move everything forward
together.
This one. Hey, it goes.
That one would be better.
Give yourself time 10. Make a little
pause. Make a little pause
and then move forward. Make some
practice.
You make a little pause at the top and
go. And again.
Little pause and we go. Great.
And the last video talks about the first
power accumulator. Uh soon we will have
a series of videos where I will explain
a little bit more in depth those those
concepts.
Look, it would be like this.
No. And then you move this one down. No.
Here.
The the guy was too thick.
Yeah. Try that.
No, just load it with the right arm.
Good. Good. But now don't don't unload
me this here. If you unload this down,
look, that will that will he Good. That
will shoot anyway.
Good.
Okay.
Now, as faster you move, as faster you
can move this one, the shorter one, the
shoulder level, the faster this one is
going to hit. Good. Now, here is the
same.
You load it.
You unload it and the club will be
faster.
Good. Now do that with the ball.
Wow. Look, look how much speed you get
in the club now.
Good. So, I hope you enjoying those
videos and I hope also that my
explanation helped you a little bit to
to understand what I was talking about.
Thank you. See you soon.
