By the end of this video, I'm going to
share with you 10 top altcoins that I
believe will make the next wave of
crypto millionaires by 2026. These are
altcoins that large investors and
institutions are quietly accumulating
right now while retail is still
sleeping. So, buckle up because some of
these altcoins are already on the move.
And make sure you watch this video all
the way to the end and pay close
attention because one of these coins
hasn't even launched yet and could make
you the most amount of money if you're
early. Plus, if you want to get access
to our professional research team's top
altcoin picks, the same team that called
altcoins like Salana, like Pendle, like
Mog, the memecoin before it even
launched that have gone on to do 20x's,
40x's, 50x's, and even over 100 X's,
then you're going to want to check out
altcoinpro.com by the end of this video.
So that way you can tap in with our team
for the next explosive altcoins on top
of what I'm going to share with you in
this video. Now, with that being said,
comment 777 if you're film blessed, if
you're feeling bullish. I want to hear
what altcoins you're the most bullish
on. So, let's dive right in. All right,
bull runners. Welcome back to the
channel. So, let's dive into the 10 top
altcoins that are most likely to create
millionaires during this bull run cycle.
They still have massive potential that
we haven't seen since the 2021 bull
market. So, we're going to cover the
fundamentals, the tokconomics, and
discuss their growth potential based on
market dynamics that are currently
happening in this market cycle. So, make
sure you subscribe if you want to see
more crypto videos like this. And as
always, you know, I'm not a financial
adviser. None of what I say is financial
advice, so don't buy. Don't sell any of
these altcoins because, as you already
know, crypto is very risky, and it could
all go to zero. So, by watching this
video, you're confirming that you're
aware of the risk. You're okay if you
get wrecked. And by no means am I making
any promises of any returns here for you
because I've been in the crypto space
for nearly 10 years, and I've seen
multiple cycles play out. I've made a
lot of money in this cycle, and I've
also watched millions disappear because
I didn't understand market timing in the
early days. And the key thing I learned
is that crypto moves in waves. And right
now, we're at the beginning of what
could be the most explosive wave we've
ever seen in the final move to the
upside. And if you're brand new to the
channel, you're pretty much entering the
market when it's the most exciting. So,
I'm not going to lie to you and tell you
that you're early here. You know, you
would have been early to get into crypto
over 10 years ago or for this bull run
cycle in 2022 and 23. So, if you're
entering into the market cycle right
now, there's still time left. Because
the difference between making
life-changing money and watching it
evaporate comes down to understanding
when to get in and when to get out. Most
people buy at the top when everyone's
talking about crypto when it's being
covered on mainstream media and they
sell at the bottom when fear takes over
and the whales are using you as exit
liquidity. And if we look at where we're
at right now in the market cycle, we're
in what I call the hope phase as we get
ready to go into optimism, belief,
thrill, and euphoria, where smart money
is accumulating the top positions that
I'm going to share with you in this
video before the masses catch on and
start buying at the top of the market in
Euphoria. So, my philosophy is very
simple. will find altcoins with real
utility, strong teams, massive growth
potential, then position size
appropriately, and have an exit strategy
because when this bull run peaks, you
need to be ready to take profits. So,
kicking off this list is Aster. Tons of
people on X are calling this the
hyperlquid killer. Aster is a
decentralized perpetual exchange built
for non-custodial trading of perpetual
contracts and spot markets designed for
everybody. Crypto newbies to season pros
understand that the real money is made
trading altcoins and decentralized
exchanges have proven to see a large
amount of liquidity inflow based on what
we saw during the last few bull run
cycles with coins like unis swap or even
pancake swap. And aster has already
racked up an impressive 500 billion in
total trading volume in the first couple
of days trading. Now, nobody knows what
percentage of that is real trading
volume versus injected trading volume
from Binance or CZ, but nonetheless,
those are very impressive numbers with
over 2 million users already and $400
million in total value lock, showing
serious traction in the DeFi space.
Here's what has everybody buzzing about
Aster. Aster offers seamless cross-chain
trading with no bridging or switching
between chains and it's not just single
chain. You simply pick a chain like the
BNB chain, Ethereum, Salana or Arbitum
and you place your trade with one click.
It pulls deep liquidity across these
markets supporting large trades with
minimal slippage. So traders can get
access to powerful tools like hidden
orders, grid trading, and up to 100x
leverage on US stock perpetuals like
Apple, Amazon, or Tesla fully settled in
crypto. And it's powered by the ZK
optimized Aster Chain, delivering fast
MEV free execution for both simple mode
beginners and pro mode veterans. and
backed by YZI Labs. The team evolved
from the APX protocol to combine
perpetual trading with yield farming,
earning endorsements from big names like
former Binance CEO and one of the
wealthiest people in the world, CZ. He's
been bull posting all over X.com about
Aster. And after digging into this
project, I'm pretty convinced that his
goal is to make it the number one DEX in
the world to even pass Hyperlquid. Now,
will that happen? We'll see. But
nonetheless, Aster is a fraction of the
value of Hyperlid based on the market
cap and has a total supply of 8 billion
tokens with a portion in circulation.
The platform's billions of dollars in
monthly trading volume are set to drive
significant token buybacks and also
creating massive pressure in demand.
Plus, since it just launched with a full
Binance listing coming soon, over 90% of
everyday traders don't even know how to
buy Aster, making this a ground floor
opportunity if you're willing to jump
through some hoops before it gets listed
on an exchange like Binance or Coinbase.
So with these metrics alone, even though
the platform is new, it's a little
clunky compared to Hyperlid. Look at
what Binance was doing in its early days
and how many glitches and things wrong
with the platform. So that gives them
room to improve. And CZ is a strategist
and he's playing 4D chess here. So if
you release a platform and it's perfect
right from the get- go, that leaves you
no room for updates for the community to
get excited about. So if everything
isn't perfect from the gate, well, when
you fix something, now you have
marketing material to post on your
Twitter. that causes the community to
get more excited, have something to look
forward to, and you could just keep
updating it over time. So, it's not
about being perfect when you start, it's
about starting and then improving over
time. So, Aster is positioned for
massive growth in the DeFi space. And as
TradeFi converges and institutions dump
in more money towards the end of this
bull run, I wouldn't be surprised to see
Aster achieve significant gains by the
end of this year and achieve a lot more
exchange listings over the next few days
alone, by the time this video comes out.
because by the time these videos get
edited, you know, price moves so
rapidly. So that's why it's important to
plug into altcoinro.com because that's
where you get the news in real time
instantly and you don't have to wait for
these videos to come out. Now, a lot of
people are coining Aster as the
hyperlquid killer. What this reminds me
of is what happened in 2021 when people
were calling Sheba Enu the Dogecoin
killer, which caused a lot of investors
to turn heads because what investors
want is multiples on their income. And
if they can find a similar or better
product at a lower market cap and
they've already achieved gains on a
large market cap project, then they're
going to rotate their capital over to
that project. Plus, listen to what CZ,
the former CEO of the largest
centralized crypto exchange in the
world, recently said about decentralized
exchanges.
Um, I think many people view like
centralized exchanges versus
decentralized exchanges. I think that's
the wrong view. It's the terminology
that makes people think they're
opposite,
but they're all tools who provide access
to the blockchain. The centralized
exchanges don't exist without
blockchains. do that. So they they only
a tool that provide access to the
decentralized world. Uh it's just that
many people are easy for many normies
you know normal users they email
password is easier than dealing with a
private key they have to encrypt and
save themselves etc. Um but there's just
two different ways to access there just
two different doors into the same uh
area and I think for any solution
provider or any builders here uh in the
space we should like we should provide
everything. Uh we shouldn't be just like
we we're not married to a centralized
exch. not married to a centralized
exchange. Um that's not the goal. Uh
that's just a means to provide access.
Uh we invest very heavily in
decentralized exchanges, the DEX per u
uh blockchain development and also many
other ecosystem players etc.
Um so I think the the uh the
decentralized DEX per are a huge market
as you mentioned
and I think that's that's just getting
started. There's so much more there's so
much more to do. I think the uh the
current model where everything's fully
transparent may or may not be the best
model. Um because uh uh yeah, you can
see a big whale putting a $300 million
short u but the guy who really want to
do 300 million short don't want you to
see it, right? So the guys were putting
that there.
Yeah, there's a game. There's for sure a
game, right?
It's it's for his effect. Uh whereas a
real large traders like institutions
that's why traditionally dark pools are
way bigger than uh uh what we call lit
order books, right? So um um yeah. So I
think this there's a lot of room to to
grow but I do think that future is
decentralized. So I think in the I've
said this many times um in the future
DEX is going to be bigger than uh CEX
and we want to invest heavily in those
areas. Yeah. We want to invest in the
things that will overturn that will
disrupt our business.
Are you already in the process of doing
that?
Oh yeah. Yeah. We invested in multiple
decks, multiple decks per uh etc. Now,
let's talk about Chainlink. The
undisputed backbone of the DeFi
ecosystem and increasingly the bridge to
traditional finance. Chainlink solves
the infamous oracle problem by securely
connecting blockchains to realworld
data. And it's evolved into
missionritical infrastructure that's
powering over $25 trillion in
transaction value across the crypto
space. What makes Chainlink so valuable
is its massive network effect. The more
protocols integrating into chain link
oracles, the stronger and more
indispensable the network becomes. And
today virtually every major DeFi
protocol like a you know GMX, Leo,
Jupiter relies on chain link for
tamperproof price feeds, real-time data
and automation. It's not just DeFi
either. Chainlink is securing tens of
billions in value while enabling
trillions in transactions. But Chainlink
has leveled up far beyond basic price
feeds. They're leading in cross-chain
interoperability with their CCIP. And
that stands for cross-chain
interoperability protocol, which enables
seamless data and value transfers across
chain, like making Worldcoins WLLD token
natively transferable between Ethereum
and the world chain. They've also
expanded into advanced computation
services, privacy preserving tech, and
connecting legacy systems to blockchain
systems with recent launches including
Lagarduard Nav, a risk adjusted oracle
for pricing tokenized real world assets
in collaboration with a Llama Risk. And
it's now live on a horizon to handle the
booming $30 billion real world asset
market. Plus, Chainlink just went live
on Plasma FDN with CCIP data streams and
data feeds optimizing for high
performance stable coin ecosystems. Now,
if that sounds complicated to you, don't
worry about understanding the critical
details there. Listen to this. The
partnerships are next level from tech
giants like Google Cloud, Amazon Web
Services, and Oracle to financial
heavyweights like Swift, Eurolear,
Fidelity, UBS, A&Z, JP Morgan, and
Mastercard. Chainlink is the go-to for
bridging TRDFI and blockchain with
ISO27001
and SOC2 compliance to boot. It's even
publishing the US government
macroeconomic data on chain and enabling
privacy for cross-chain transactions.
And on the token side, Link has a fixed
supply of 1 billion tokens with about
60% in circulation. And what's exciting
is the chain link reserve which uses
onchain and off-chain revenue from
enterprise adoption to buy back a link.
They've recently accumulated over 47,000
tokens in a single update, bringing
total holdings to over 370,000 link as
of September of 2025. And whale activity
is ramping up, too, with millions of
links scooped up recently, signifying
strong investor confidence. As Trad
fully embraces blockchain, think
tokenized assets, stable coins becoming
programmable money, and atomic
settlements. Chainlink is positioned as
an essential infrastructure layer. Every
smart contract needs realworld
connectivity and they're going to lean
on chain link. And in a world where
decentralized finance and traditional
finance converge together, chain link
isn't just essential in the space, it's
inevitable. Now, let's talk about Near
Protocol, the layer 1 blockchain as the
go-to for AI agents and scalable web 3
apps. Tons of posts are hyping it as an
execution layer where AI meets
blockchain. And recent upgrades like
Nightshade 2.0 know putting 10,000
transactions per second live for DeFi
and decentralized apps. Their goal of
hitting 100,000 transactions per second
could be possible. And Near Protocol is
already smashing records. 46 million
monthly active users as of May of this
year, 218 million in DeFi total value
locked, and over 2,500 monthly active
developers per Electronic Capitals
report fueling the AI narrative tools.
They've secured billions in transaction
value with low fees in 1.2 second
finality. And here's what's got everyone
buzzing about Near Protocol. It's one of
the top AI projects in the space. And
Near's chain signatures enable seamless
cross-chain actions where no bridges are
needed for intents like swaps, lending,
and staking. With 1 million swaps
processed already, it supports AI
agents, owning assets, transacting
autonomously, and integrating with
ecosystems like Toncoin and Polygon
powered by dynamic sharding and ZK
proofs. It's targeting 1 million
transactions per second by year end.
Now, we'll see if they get there, but
outpacing rivals for microp payments and
high throughput AI and backed by a
rockstar team from top tech firms, Ne's
evolved from a developer friendly chain
to AI powerhouse in the space, earning
partnerships with Amazon Web Services,
Google Cloud, Circle, Bitwise,
Everclear, which processes over a
billion dollars in crosschain stable
coins, Deutsch Telecom as a validator,
and recently Allora network for
predictive AI signals. From the token
side, Near has a total supply of 1.2 2
billion tokens with nearly all of it in
circulation and 5% annual inflation
mostly burned via fees creating
deflationary pressure. Plus, it's
undervalued below a $4 billion market
cap, 85% below its $20 all-time high and
a bit wise ETP opening institutional
doors. If AI adoption continues to scale
in the blockchain space, which it's
inevitable, it's not a question of if,
it's just how long it takes. With these
metrics and catalysts, NER is positioned
for massive growth as AI altcoins make a
comeback the closer that we get to 2026.
Now, let's talk about Sooie, one of the
most technically advanced layer 1
blockchains ever built. Lighting up X as
the next Salana with its fast speed in
developer Surge created by former meta
engineers from the DM project. Suie
boasts serious Silicon Valley
credentials and is exploding with over
$2 billion in total value locked as of
August of this year. It's up 70% in
recent months alongside 31 million
active accounts in daily DEX volumes
hitting $368 million in quarter 2.
Zooie's processed 7.34 billion in total
transactions with sub400 millisecond
finality securing billions in DeFi value
across lending, trading, and real world
assets. And what makes SUI unique is its
object- ccentric data model and move
programming language enabling parallel
transaction processing. While other
chains handle one at a time, Sooie
cranks out up to 300,000 transactions
per second in different tests. With real
world swaps in 700 millisecond in fees
under a penny so from what we've seen in
the development activity on Sooie, it's
absolutely incredible with 5,000 plus
monthly builders, onboarding for AI
agents, gaming and enterprise
decentralized apps, plus tools like ZK
login for gasless entry. And what's got
everyone excited about sooie and talking
about it and comparing it to Salana kind
of like how Shibbeini was the Dogecoin
killer or Aster is coming for the crown
for Hyperliquid's volume. In my opinion,
I think Suie is a much better play than
Salana for the rest of this bull run
cycle because Sooie's parallel execution
powers seamless realorld assets and high
volume DeFi. So there's no bottlenecks
for protocols like Cedus which is
concentrated liquidity through the
decentralized exchange or Nav'i which
offers lending with 114 million in total
value lock. It integrates with walrus
for decentralized storage and seal for
privacy while also supporting meme coins
and stable coins like USDC. And they
recently launched Sooie Play, a
blockchain native gaming console and
Birds app which has 5 million users
gamifying DeFi. And they're backed by a
dream team of X Meta cryptographers at
Mist Labs. Suie's evolved from
scalability contender to a multis-
sector powerhouse earning partnerships
with Google through their AI payments
protocol. Microsoft offering enterprise
integration. Mastercard have virtual
cards at over 20,000 merchants.
Fireblocks through custody 21 shares.
Van Ec Grayscale through the Sooie Trust
and even Trump backed world liberty
financial for treasury holds. Plus a
US-based SUI ETF filing in March adds
regulatory tailwinds to this project.
And SUI has a total supply of 10 billion
tokens with 35% in circulation.
Investing through 2030, but 2% annual
burns from fees also create deflationary
pressure. So with SUI's current market
cap under 11 billion, $55% below its
all-time high and ETF news on the
horizon along with AI gaming catalyst,
Van is forecasting a $16 SUI by the end
of the year. So, we'll see if that
happens. But Suie is positioned either
way for massive growth as another layer
1 in the space. Comparing it to Salana's
2021 scalability frenzy reminds me of
how parallel processing ignited that
run. Now, let's talk about XRP. And I
know XRP is controversial, but there's a
reason institutional investors have been
accumulating throughout the bare market.
And now, postclarity, it's exploding all
over social media as the global
settlement king. Listen, Ripple has been
positioning themselves to lead the new
global digital payment system for over a
decade with ondemand liquidity
processing a staggering $1.3 trillion in
quarter 2 of this year alone. While XRP
Ledger's total value locked hit $120
million after the EVM side chain
launched, drawing 1,400 smart contracts
in its first week and surging 5x overall
since the SEC win. Daily active
addresses jumped from 10,000 over
100,000. So Ripple has not been
targeting the crypto sector and the echo
chamber of people that are investing in
DeFi projects. They're going after a
much bigger client here. That's not just
global payments, but that's also
tokenizing real world assets. And if you
just look at the payment sector alone,
well, there's trillions of dollars in
crossber value every single day. And
with less than 5-second finality and
fees under a fraction of a fraction of a
penny, what makes XRP unique is Ripple's
ISO 222 compliance, the new
international standard that all banks
are going to be transitioning to by
November of this year, enabling
seamless, lowcost remittances in the
$150 trillion annual crossber market.
And unlike slower legacy systems, XRP
bridges fiat and crypto for instant
settlements, powering DeFi on the XRP
ledger with automated market makers and
real world asset tokenization via
multi-purpose tokens. The activity from
Ripple is off the charts. With 19 global
events in 2025, their stable coin RLUSD
launched and backed by BNY Melon, and
upgrades like the EVM side chain
attracting Ethereum decentralized apps
for hybrid liquidity. Here's what has
everyone excited about XRP regardless of
the conspiracy theories and all the hate
out there as well too for people that
don't like XRP and calling it the
banker's token. Well, XRP's on demand
liquidity eliminates preunding from
banks through Nostro and Vostro accounts
slashing costs in high volume corridors
while the ledger supports CBDC pilots
and tokenized assets recently processing
billions of dollars in real world asset
volumes. They're integrating with
ecosystems like Hidden Road, which
Ripple acquired for about $1.2 billion
for post-trade ops in the FX and repo
market, and new innovations like native
automated market makers, boosting the
DeFi total value lock to 80 million
plus. We're seeing all these companies
line up to file ETFs for XRP and we're
just waiting on the SEC to approve them
by the tail end of October with Rex
Ospres XRPR pulling $37 million on day
one and predictions of $100 for XRP as
institutions pile in over the next few
bull run cycles. Everyone wants to know
what is XRP going to go do by the end of
this year. Well, backed by Ripple's
powerhouse team, Brad Garlinghouse, the
CEO. Before joining Ripple, he served as
the senior vice president at AOL and
president of consumer applications at
Yahoo. Ripple also has Rosie Rios, the
43rd US Treasurer, who oversaw $13
trillion in US currency operations on
their board. She's now allin with
Ripple. There's also Kahina Van Djk, who
was the former chief compliance officer
at Western Union and global head of
compliance at HSBC, who led regulatory
frameworks for global payments at
Mastercard and City. There's also
Anthony Welfare who's the chief
financial officer. He has 20 plus years
in global finance and was the former CFO
at Credit Swiss's APAC division and
Barlay's wealth management group
managing multi-billion dollar portfolios
and regulatory compliance for
crossborder banking. And that's just a
small fraction of their team members.
Ripple's team is insane. And bottom line
is XRP's evolved from just a payments
token to a full DeFi hub earning
partnerships with over 300 plus
institutions like Sander, American
Express, SBI Holdings, which have
started using XRP for Minces, Moneygram,
ECB for CBDC's, Grayscale through the
XRP Trust, JP Morgan, Mastercard, an SBI
bank going live January of this year,
plus Franklin Templeton for US tokenized
funds, and the SEC lawsuit wrapping up
with only $50 million in penalties,
providing full regulatory clarity in
classifying XRP as a nonsecurity for
retail, sparking a 300% surge to over
$3. Now, XRP is sitting below $3 and has
a total supply of 100 billion tokens
with 55% in circulation and Ripple's
escrow releasing steadily every single
month and then whatever isn't sold gets
put back in escrow. So, a lot of people
are concerned that Ripple could just
release the whole escrow and just dump
all XRP on the open market. And if they
wanted to rug the project, they would
have done it already. XRP's remained in
the top 10 even during the entire SEC
lawsuit, plus at a $170 billion market
cap, trading at $2.80 as of this video,
up from 55 post SEC lawsuit. With the
ISO 222 migration on the horizon by
November in real world asset narratives
surging, XRP is positioned for explosive
growth as traditional finance companies
focus on tokenization and remittances go
on chain. Now, let's talk about XLM,
Stellar Lumens, which is basically XRP's
younger brother, but with a laser focus
on financial inclusion and serving
unbanked populations worldwide. And it's
surging all over X as the quiet real
world asset powerhouse. Founded by Jed
MB, which is Ripple's co-founder back in
2014. Stellar was built by the nonprofit
Stellar Development Foundation for
decentralized lowcost global payments.
and it's now exploding with protocol 23
upgrades and $3 billion in real world
assets targeted onchain by year end. The
network's DeFi total value locked hit
$150 million in quarter 2 of this year,
which is up 80% year-on-year with over 9
million active enterprise wallets
processing a,000 transactions per second
at near zero fees in less than 5second
finality, securing trillions in
remittances for the $700 billion annual
market. What makes XLM unique is also
the ISO 222 positioning for the Swift
migration completely replacing the old
banking messaging systems with built-in
decks for asset swaps and sore brand
smart contracts enabling DeFi
tokenization CBDC pilots. It's far more
decentralized than XRP a lot of people
say via their open- source governance.
But nonetheless, development activity is
booming with 5,000 plus monthly builders
and tools like Rustbased Sor Brand
slashing costs by 40% onboarding
decentralized apps for microp payments
and stable coins. Here's what has
everyone talking about XLM and super
excited about this project because
they're connecting fiat to blockchain
for seamless remittances. There's no
bridges, just instant settlement
powering tools like PYUSD, which is
PayPal's stablecoin that launched in
June, and Franklin Templeton's $446
million tokenized US treasuries. It
supports CBDC initiatives with UNDP and
tokenized funds via ARX, targeting 5
million monthly users and $ 1.5 billion
in total value lock by end of year with
integrations for real-time euro
transfers via SEPA Instant. Recent wins
include Marcato Bitcoin issuing $200
million on Stellar at Meridian 2025 and
partnerships with Paxos, Ono, Etherfuse,
and SG Forge for 3 billion in real world
assets. And Exelum's anchor network
eliminates intermediaries for
remittances powering stable coin hubs
and tokenized bonds with recent
integrations processing billions in real
world asset flows. and they have a
powerhouse team led by Danielle Dixon
who's the CEO, the former COO of Mosilla
and a World Economic Forum advisor
shaping global blockchain standards.
There's also Jed Maleb who's the
co-founder and chief architect and was
Ripple's founder in Mount Gox creator
with 20 plus years in crypto innovation.
There's Nicholas Barry who's the CTO who
is an ex Microsoft in IBM engineer
scaling stellar's a thousand plus
transaction per second infrastructure.
There's Candace Kelly who's the chief
legal officer who is the former GC at
Coinbase with 15 plus years in
regulatory compliance and Jason Kapala
who's the COO and X Visa and PayPal
operations leader driving financial
inclusion. So that's just a few of their
heavy hitters. The bottom line is this.
XLMs evolved from just a payment token
to a defying real world asset hub and
with partnerships like IBM, Money Grand,
Franklin Templeton, Circle and CBDC
trials over in Ukraine, Paloo, Brazil,
its nonprofit status ensures regulatory
favor with no SEC hurdles driving a 200%
surge to 25 cents in quarter 3 of this
year. Now, XLM has a total supply of 50
billion tokens with 30 billion in
circulation with burdens from fees
creating deflationary pressure. Plus, at
a 12 billion market cap, trading below
40 cents, up from just 8 cents pre-
rally with the end of the year ISO
migration in real world assets surging,
XLM is positioned for explosive growth,
potentially even more than XRP as
tokenized assets go onchain. Now, let's
talk about Onondo, one of the most
exciting altcoins in the real world
asset space. It's exploding all over X
as the real world asset kingpin,
bridging Treadfi to DeFi. While
everyone's chasing memecoins, Ono is
quietly tokenizing trillions in
traditional assets like US treasuries
and bonds, making them accessible
onchain. It's O USG fund alone has
racked up over $1.2 billion in market
cap with total value lock surging to
over 1.6 6 billion as of September this
year and it's up over 200% year-onear
and they're processing billions in
tokenized transactions with 4.3% APY on
lending platform Flux Finance drawing
50,000 users and 167 million in total
value locked for overcolateralized loans
and what makeso unique is its
institutional-grade tokenization on theo
chain enabling permissioned assets like
tokenized ETFs and stocks with
regulatory compliance baked in. And
unlike retail only DeFi, Ono's global
markets launched with $242 million in
total value locked in its first week,
powering cross-chain yields and real
world assets at scale. The developer
activity is pretty steady here at around
one active dev weekly, but integrations
hit 80 plus across eight networks. And
the real world asset narrative is
massive with Black Rockck tokenizing
money market funds and JP Morgan
experimenting with blockchain bonds.
Ono's at the epicenter ranking number
three in real world asset total value
locked on defy llama ando's flux finance
offers f tokens for yieldbearing lending
of USG and USDC while bridge enables
seamless minting and burning across
chains recently processing about $200
billion in tokenized treasuries. It
integrates with a for real world asset
collateral and Mastercard for non- US
payments targeting a hundred trillion
dollar markets through the asset
management industry with $50 billion in
real world asset projections by the end
of the year. And X is absolutely lit.
It's on fire with threads on its cosmic
IBC interoperability for tokenized ETFs
outpacing stocks and NASDAQ's ETP filing
holding $250 million in total value
locked. And amidst the recent market
pullback, well, this project is gearing
up for a long-term mega run here with a
powerhouse team from Goldman Sachs,
Coinbase, including Nathan Alman, who's
the CEO. He's an ex Goldman Sachs
structuring lead with 15 plus years in
experience. There's also Pinku Serana,
the head of strategy, who is a former
Coinbase product manager. Justin Smith,
who's the CTO. He's a blockchain
engineer from Consensus, and also they
have advisers like former Black Rockck
execs. Ono's evolved from just a real
world asset pioneer to the real world
asset front runner. Ando has a total
supply of 10 billion tokens with 30% in
circulation and gradual investing
through 2030 at roughly a $3 billion
market cap trading below $1 with Black
Rockck integrations and ETFs in the
pipeline. Ono is positioned for
explosive growth as the hundred trillion
Trady industry tokenizes real world
assets on chain. Now let's talk about
SEI. One of the most slept on layer 1
blockchains built specifically for
trading and DeFi and it's exploding on X
as the DEX speed. Designed by X Meta and
Google engineers, SEI is optimized for
highfrequency trading with its twin
turbo consensus hitting 22,000 orders
per second and sub 300 millisecond
finality. It's 1,400 times faster than
Ethereum's 15 transactions per second.
And as of September of this year, SEI's
total value lock has surged to over $2.5
billion, up 150% year-on-year with 1.2
million daily active wallets and $500
million plus in daily DEX volume,
securing billions in DeFi value across
protocols like S Swap and Vortex. What
makes SEI unique is its orderbook
ccentric design, blending centralized
exchange- like speed with DeFi's
decentralization, enabling spot,
perpetual futures, and real world assets
with no slippage. Unlike general purpose
L1s, SEI's paralyzed EVM and COSM swap
support powers 10,000 plus transactions
per second for trading decentralized
apps with fees under a penny. And
developer activity on SEI is redhot.
With 30,000 plus monthly builders and
integrations like SEI v2 slashing
latency by 50% for real-time order
execution, SEI's enclave tech ensures
MEV free trades while its SEIDB
optimizes data for high throughput.
Recently processing over $1 billion in
daily volume. It powers dexes like
Astreport and lending on Lavana with
crosschain bridges to Cosmos and
Ethereum, enabling seamless USDC and
real world asset flows. Now, I know that
was a mouthful and I don't expect you to
understand all of that, but social media
is absolutely hyped and fired up right
now on integrations with a for tokenized
collateral and Binance for futures.
Plus, a recent VANC ETP filing is
boosting institutional access backed by
SEI Labs powerhouse team including the
co-founder who was an ex- Robin Hood
engineer along with Jeff Fang who's also
the co-founder. He was a former Uber
data lead and Dan Edelbeck who's the
CEO, he was an ex Google AI architect
driving blockchain innovation and
analyta
systems engineer with 15 plus years in
high performance tech. So a lot of these
CEOs and these powerhouse teams of these
projects either worked at like Google,
they worked at IBM, they worked in
Silicon Valley, they worked for
Facebook. They all have very credible
tech backgrounds and SEI's evolved from
just a trading L1 to a DeFi and real
world asset hub as well too. From the
token perspective, SEI has a total
supply of 10 billion tokens with 60%
circulation investing through 2030. It's
under a $2 billion market cap and it's
trading below 30 cents right now. And
with Binance futures and ETPs in the
pipeline, SEI is positioned for
explosive growth as onchain trading and
DeFi continue to scale. Now, let's talk
about HAR, Hideera Hashgraph. One of the
most undervalued enterprise blockchains
with partnerships from the biggest
corporations in the world and it's
surging on social media as the silent
enterprise giant. The governing council
from Hideera leverages Hashgraph tech
for 10,000 plus transactions per second,
ABFT consensus and ultra low fees under
a fraction of a fraction of a penny,
making it ideal for supply chain, real
world assets, carbon accounting. Its
DeFi total value locked has hit 114
million in September, up 52% monthly
despite a 9% stable coin dip to 69
million with 42 billion in circulation.
They're securing billions in enterprise
value amidst 500,000 daily transactions.
And what makes HAR unique is its
energyefficient hashgraph handling
enterprise decentralized apps with
infinite scalability and ISO 222
compliance for payments outpacing rivals
in carbon credits and tokenized assets.
And unlike public chains, HAR's council
governance ensures stability with 5,000
plus monthly devs building via open-
source upgrades like Project Hero and
EVM compatibility. Here's what's got
everyone excited about HAR. Swift has
been testing crossber payments and
Nvidia has been collaborating with them
for AI secured data processing $1
billion in real world assets. They
support tokenized credit funds like
Apollo's $50 million launch and
Wyoming's FR&T stablecoin with ecosystem
growth and refi projects targeting $150
trillion by 2030. And there's tons of
threads all over X and the media talking
about ETF filings from NASDAQ, Canary
Capital, Gayscale with 90% approval odds
by year end. And Hideera's team is
absolutely stacked, including Mansharman
who's the co-founder and chairman who
has 20 plus years of experience
pioneering distributed ledger systems.
Leman Baird who's the co-founder and
chief scientist who's the inventor of
the Hashgraph technology with patents
and consensus tech. There's Charles
Atkins who's the CEO. He's an exIBBM
leader scaling enterprise blockchains.
Brett McDow, the former chair, he's a
world economic forum adviser on digital
identity and council members from
Google, IBM, Boeing, you name it. H bars
evolved from a distributed ledger
technology innovator to global
enterprise standard. And the token has a
total supply of about 50 billion tokens
with 42 billion in circulation and a
fixed capped post initial released. But
fees burned create deflationary pressure
for H bar. And it's under a $10 billion
market cap, trading at around 21 cents
at the time of making this video. And
with Nvidia partnerships and ETF
momentum building, HAR is also
positioned for an explosive growth as
enterprise adoption and ISO 222 goes
global. Now, let's talk about the base
chain. The Ethereum layer 2 incubator by
Coinbase exploding on social media as
the ultimate airdrop play. Initially,
Bass said that they wouldn't be
launching a token, but now they've
changed their mind. And with a native
token in early exploration, as of this
month, Bass hasn't launched its coin
yet, but it's on the horizon. Because at
Base Camp 2025, Jesse Pulock announced
plans to explore a token for
decentralized governance and user
incentives, which sparked hype for a
potential quarter 1 2026 airdrop,
rewarding users early. Now, BAS is
already crushing it with $5 billion in
total value locked, over 20 million
monthly active addresses, and 1 million
plus daily users, securing billions in
DeFi and NFT value with sub-second
finality and fees under a penny as well.
But what makes Bass unique is its EVM
compatible optimistic rollup scaling
Ethereum to over 10,000 transactions per
second while leveraging Coinbase's 110
million user base for onboarding. And
unlike other layer 2s, it's US-based
with regulatory compliance here through
Coinbase. This ensures that the token is
going to be compliant from day one.
Currently using Ethereum for gas, but
eyeing a native coin for staking and
fees. And developer activity on the base
chain is absolutely insane. With over
5,000 monthly builders powering
decentralized apps like Uniswap, a
Coinbase wallet, plus a new Salana
bridge for cross-chain assets, here's
what's got everyone talking about the
new basecoin launch. There's a massive
airdrop potential that's going to drive
users to farm on the chain. And when you
interact with the chain, it can grow
your rewards to increase your airdrop.
Now, our team at Altcoin Pro talks about
the top airdrops. And so, we're
definitely going to be covering this and
showing you guys how to take advantage
of it, similar to how we showed our
team, the arbitrum airrop, and some of
our members made tens of thousands to
hundreds of thousands of dollars through
that airdrop along with other airdrops.
Now, I don't guarantee results for you
because it depends on your activity on
chain and how much time you have per
day. But with less than an hour per day,
if you apply our airdrop farming
strategies, you can make a lot of money
in this market that you wouldn't have
normally made had you not known about a
protocol or a project launching. See,
most people, they just don't know about
these projects launching because they
have a full-time job. Maybe you're a
truck driver for a living. Maybe you
work in sales. Maybe you, you know, flip
burgers at McDonald's. It doesn't matter
your experience level. As long as you
take time to interact with these chains,
you could benefit from their airdrops.
And I'm telling you, Bass is going to be
one of the biggest one of all time
because the base chain supports DeFi
with $2 billion in DEX volume and NFTts
via OpenC integrating with chain link
for oracles and BlackRock for tokenized
funds backed by Coinbase's powerhouse
team, including Jesse Pulock. He's the
ex-coinbase product lead with 10 plus
years in scaling crypto infrastructure.
Max Brownsburg who's the VP in
X-coinbased wallet head who's driving
user growth. Will Robinson, he's an ex
Googlele engineer and an adviser from
the Ethereum Foundation. They're setting
base up to evolve from just a L2 scaler
to a decentralized ecosystem hub. And
there's no tokconomics yet for the coin
because they just recently made the
announcement, so you're hearing about it
first. But there's a lot of speculation
pointing to a 10 billion supply with 20
to 30% airdropped based on layer 2
trends. But we'll see what they do for
that because there's no market cap yet.
There's no tokconomics released yet, but
I would expect this coin to crack the
top 100 in market cap within the first
week, let alone 24 to 48 hours, similar
to what happened with Aster, right after
launch because of the backing they have
behind this project. So, make sure
you're subscribed to this channel here
and you're plugged into our private
community through the link below inside
of altcoinpro.com so you get notified
first and you don't miss out when the
launch date is announced. So, you can be
able to benefit if they do an airdrop or
something completely unique that
nobody's seen before. We're going to
cover it first. So, there you have it.
10 top altcoins that I believe will
create the next wave of millionaires in
2025. Now, if you expect to make
millions from just $100 or $1,000 in
these projects, we need to be realistic
here because right now we're at the
phase in the market cycle where it makes
the most sense to focus on the winners.
You see, winners focus on winning and
people who lose a lot of money try and
focus on the smallest market caps at
this stage in the cycle when we're not
at the tail end yet. So, right now, if
you're going to play the rotation game,
the smartest move that you could
possibly make to maximize your $100 or
$1,000 or even $10,000 without losing
absolutely everything is by focusing on
the winners. And these aren't just
random altcoin picks. These are altcoins
with real utility, strong teams,
long-term potential and longevity in the
market, powerhouse teams, and these are
all fundamental things that you need for
massive growth potential. Now, remember,
the spending power of the dollar
continues to decline with blockchain
technology seeing massive institutional
adoption. The trend is very clear. The
opportunity is massive. And if you want
to know about the next hidden gems
before they explode, when that time
comes to rotate capital into the small
cap projects before they explode, then
make sure you check out alcoinpro.com
through the link in the description
below where our team is going to share
their top picks early with all of the
research and analysis that you need to
do your own research and to position
yourself appropriately because this bull
run, it won't last forever, my friend.
But if you play it right, you could set
yourself up for generational wealth. So,
I'll see you on the next video. As
always, you know what to do. Stay
bullish.
