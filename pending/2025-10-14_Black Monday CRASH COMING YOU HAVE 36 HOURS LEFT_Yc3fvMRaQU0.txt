Trillions of dollars have been wiped off
the markets in the past 24 hours as one
anonymous mysterious trader made over 1
billion
with a perfectly timed short that was
executed one minute before Donald Trump
slapped 100% tariffs on China. So what
happened yesterday? this bloodbath. Was
this just one manipulated price move
from a trader who maybe had more
information than most of us? Or if we
zoom out a little bit, is this the
beginning of yet another dramatic
October crash? Because most people
forget that some of the largest stock
market crashes in history have begun in
October. We can see here the 1929 stock
market crash began in October. That was
again a 90% crash that began the Great
Depression. We also have the Black
Monday crash which began on October
19th. This began on well, you you
guessed it, October. And then in 2008,
the global financial crisis. This was an
enormous 50% crash in the markets. And
when did this begin? Of course, October
2008. And we even have the massive stock
market panic of 1907.
This also began in October. But what I
find a little bit interesting is Black
Rockck was making some pretty
interesting moves that I want to cover
in a moment. But I first want to have a
look at what is happening with the stock
market before we look at what was one of
the largest liquidation events in
history. What is happening in the stock
market? Is this the beginning of the
hailed crash that so many people are
talking about? You can probably see your
favorite trading account on Twitter
posting all of these comparison charts
saying the stock market crash just
began. Now, what's interesting, I
believe, is we've seen this play out
before. We've seen this story. Trump
just announced 100% tariffs on China.
This is what caused the dramatic
collapse in markets yesterday. Uh but
we've kind of seen this play out just
earlier in the year. Let's not forget
there was a little bit of a kathuffle in
the markets in April when Trump wiped $9
trillion off the market because of guess
what? Tariffs. Again, this is the chart
that I started today's video on. Now,
when you zoom in on this chart, it looks
scary, doesn't it? I mean, look at that
red candle. That is just, by the way,
that's an enormous move in the equity
markets. If I were to zoom in here, the
S&P 500 crashed from 673 to 651. That's
a 3% move. The S&P 500, the last time I
checked, was over $50 trillion. So that
would represent nearly $2 trillion wiped
off the S&P 500 in.
But have a look at where I zoomed out to
this here where this big red vertical
line is. This is April 2025. Earlier in
the year, the equity markets had, let's
measure it. This was about a 23%
correction. And why did this happen when
it did in April 2025? This was once
again because of tariffs, more tariff
scares. But the liquidation event we saw
yesterday,
I do want to put it into context because
a lot of people are saying this is the
beginning of the end. This is the
beginning of a 1929
90% stock market crash and we're headed
for a great depression. I'm not sure
whether we're going to see that. I I
really don't believe we're going to see
a 90% uh crash, but these type of
liquidation events
typically typically typically
these don't mark the tops or the market
rolling over. This, I believe, has a lot
of similarities to 2020. Again, let's
have a look at the crash that happened
in early 2020. Look at this purple line.
This is actually a chart of Bitcoin. At
the time, it was really struggling to
get above $10,000. We tapped that purple
line on three or four occasions. And we
saw that massive liquidation event. And
after that, Bitcoin rocketed. All stocks
went to the moon. Bitcoin rallied from
3,800 to 65,000 in a matter of what, 6
months. It was a hell of a crash. Again,
you guys know I'm not a technical
analysis YouTube channel. It's not what
we're about, but we're trying to tell a
broader story here because we can see a
little similarity. Have a look at that
purple line on the right hand side of
this chart. This is Bitcoin. We had
three attempts to get over 123. We had
this massive wipeout and liquidation,
which to just put things into
perspective destroyed so much capital. I
you guys are not going to believe it how
much capital was liquidated yesterday.
Let's again before we turn back to the
equity markets, let's look at the damage
it caused in the quote unquote crypto
market. We can see that the 2020 crash
saw $1.2 billion in liquidations. Again,
let's not forget Bitcoin crashed 60% in
one day. People thought the world was
ending. People thought the stock markets
weren't going to open for a year. But
look at how little capital was
liquidated in that event. 1.2 billion.
The FTX crash in 2022, which again, I'll
remind you, marked a bottom, saw $1.6
billion in liquidations. Yesterday, we
saw $19 billion
in liquidations. This was nearly 20
times bigger than the wipeout we saw in
March 2020 when Bitcoin shared what, 60%
overnight. And again, I'll remind you
after that liquidation,
this is the chart of Bitcoin. Right now,
we're sitting at, last time I checked,
$110,000
per coin. So, to put things into
perspective, comparatively,
we're doing pretty well. Comparatively,
Bitcoin is down about 12% from its
all-time highs. It would potentially
suggest
I don't think I don't think this is
speculation. I think this is just fact.
Bitcoin held up so much better than most
of the other markets. Uh obviously the
S&P 500 only went down 3%. It's a much
bigger much bigger much bigger market.
Let's recognize that. But what's again
interesting to uh be aware of some of
these altcoins literally went to zero
yesterday. We're talking about
multibillion, multiund billion dollar
altcoins. Look like this. This, for
example, is an altcoin. It's called
Sooie. It went from $360
to 55 in an hour. No, that's not a
mistake. That is literally an 85%
correction in an hour. And there were so
many tweets on Twitter right now of
people blowing up their entire trading
accounts. So many people went bankrupt
yesterday. Again, it's horrible when
people lose money. I want to be very
clear here. It's there's a lot of sad
stories that came out yesterday. Uh
there's a lot of people who lost a lot
of money. Again, we always tell you
please be very very careful with your
trading. On a little bit of a brighter
note, uh it looks as if somebody nailed
this crash. Jim Kramer, the the meme
inverse Kramer strikes again. He
tweeted, "Buy crypto when it was about
125,000."
And well, all I'm going to say is the
meme has once again held true. It is uh
it's an interesting correlation uh
between uh what Jim Kramer tweets and
what the markets do. But what I find
even more interesting
is there was $19 billion wiped off the
stock market.
Sorry, wiped out in liquidations. But
look at who bought.
Black Rockck bought $5 billion of
Bitcoin at an average price of $105,000.
Don't forget the price of Bitcoin was at
$105,000
for a matter of minutes.
literally minutes.
Somehow Larry Frink was able to
accumulate
$45,000
Bitcoin
in a matter of minutes. Again, if this
tweet is accurate, that's a $5 billion
buy. Think about that. That's $45,000
coins.
We know that only 450 Bitcoin is mined
every day. This is 100 days worth of
supply.
Don't you just think that's a little bit
interesting?
I've got a little bit of a conspiracy
theory with Black Rockck involved that I
want to get to in a moment because
there's a lot of red flags and let's
just call it what it is.
Interesting coincidences in the markets
that I want to cover. But before I get
there, I just want to also have a look
at another little bit of a dislocation
we're seeing in the markets because I
found this tweet. I found it
fascinating.
Gold crossed $4,000 earlier in the week.
And it is very, very rare that when gold
doubles this aggressively and this
quickly that there's not a serious
issue in financial markets.
We can see the last times that gold
rallied as quickly as it did was in Rome
in 235 to 284 AD.
This preceded the collapse of the Roman
Empire. Gold doubled again in the 1600s
as the Spanish Empire collapsed.
We saw something similar in 1789
during the French Revolution, the
aftermarks of the French Revolution. We
also saw this in 1921
during the German hyperinflation.
Gold had an insane rally, a big spike.
We saw the same thing in 1971
when the gold window was closed by
Richard Nixon.
Gold soared by 2,400%.
And then we saw a ruble collapse and a
gold rally in 1991
as the Soviet Union went through a
little bit of turmoil. And now we're
seeing the same thing again.
I will remind you I I think watching
what gold is doing
is incredibly important. Again, gold is
what does Luke Groman call it?
It was one of the last functioning fire
alarms that was telling us there's a
problem with the financial system. Now
again, just appreciate and recognize the
chart of gold right now because it is
going absolutely parabolic. If I put
this on the monthly, you'll see what I
mean. It's it's a very interesting uh
look at that. I I mean
that just screams hyperinflation. Now, I
know a lot of people say, "Oh, we'll
never see hyperinflation." But that
chart right there screams we're seeing a
currency crisis. So, we got gold showing
some really interesting signs.
We have tariffs
returning to the markets and we have Jim
Kramer tweeting crazy things. And we
have altcoins going to zero. I'm more
interested in what comes next.
Are we going to see another one of these
enormous stock market crashes in
October?
Again, I'm not a I'm not a trader.
I'm not someone who's going to make a
call either way because nobody knows
what's going to happen. Nobody has a
clue where the markets are going to go
in the short term. Absolutely nobody
except for
except for
except for the trader who made a very
coincidentally timed
uh trade a one minute before Trump
announced his tariffs yesterday. I want
to dive into that in a moment because
that is
let me just call it what it is. It's
suspicious. That's what it is. It's
incredibly suspicious. Uh that's
I think
I want to read this tweet first.
This tweet's an interesting one because
it helps to explain what happened. A
single colossal Bitcoin whale shorted at
the exact peak. Then just minutes
before the market shattering crash piled
on millions more in shorts. So, this is
the story right now.
A whale,
the last time I checked, uh, it was like
one minute before Trump announced the
100%
tariffs.
Have a look at this. This is a tweet
right here. Coffeezilla tweeted this
out. He's made a name for himself for
following fraud. I watched his video
that he released today, just a couple of
hours ago, and it was, let's just say,
insightful. So, we can see a whale
placed a short exactly 1 minute before
Trump threatened tariffs against China.
This is his wallet. The last short was
placed at 8:49
GMT.
Trump tweeted at 850
GMT. Oh, isn't that just incredible
luck? How about that? Now, it's worth
noting this whale made nearly a billion
dollars. When we add up
just how much money they made in what,
an hour, it's kind of insane when you
start thinking about it.
I uh it's hilarious reading some of
these comments. The whailing question.
Was it somebody inside the Oval Office?
There's some great bees. Orange wizard
of tra of terrace immediately halves
your portfolio.
I want to
Isn't that Isn't that interesting? I
want to talk a little bit more about the
coincidences in a moment. First, I want
to talk a little bit more about are we
witnessing a top? I've been seeing a lot
of people say we've topped, the markets
are all over, crashes incoming. What I
will say is that I watch this is called
a bull a Bitcoin bull market peak
indicator. This tracks 30 different
indicators to see whether we've hit a
top.
Not one of them has hit.
You got 30 indicators here. You've got
the PI cycle top indicator, the Bitcoin
rainbow chart. You guys know what I
think of charts, but I'm going to show
you all the data, even if I disagree
with it. The 22day RSI, Bitcoin
dominance, Bitcoin reserve risk,
Bitcoin's 4-year moving average, crypto,
Bitcoin bull run index. There's a ton of
different though. Oh, here we go. The
golden ratio multiplier. You got a ton
of metrics here that have got a really
good track record for predicting the
tops in Bitcoin. Not one of them have
hit.
I will say that. I think that's kind of
interesting.
There's a lot of people really bearish
right now. And typically, you don't see
that amount of bearishness
at
the exact top of a market. Typically, we
don't crash 80% after you see
$18 billion dollars of liquidations from
leverage traders.
Again, I'm I'm not making a directional
call here because I don't know. I have
no idea, but I want to at least show you
both sides of the story
or because all I'm seeing, all I'm
seeing right now on the timeline is
bearishness. Seeing a lot of people
saying it's all over. A lot of people
a lot of people predicting the top.
Here's another one of these top
predictions. We can see here
based on previous cycles,
a lot of people are saying October 2025
was the absolute top for Bitcoin.
And by the way, there was actually an
anonymous prediction made 3 years ago.
We kind of jokingly showed you this
tweet earlier in the week. Two years
ago, someone said that Bitcoin would top
on October 6,
2025.
Literally the day before it hit that new
all-time high at $126,000.
Coincidence?
Coincidence or prophecy? Look, I
personally think it was a coincidence.
I don't think we've topped, but I think
that's a pretty fascinating tweet. Not
going to lie about it. It's a very
interesting tweet. Everybody's been
talking about this week, and from a
timing analysis, would make sense that
Bitcoin tops
in Q4 2025, but it just
just doesn't quite add up. That's what I
will say. None of this adds up for me.
you you very very rarely see these types
of liquidations at the at the tops of a
market like we've showed you.
Typically, it's more likely the bottom.
Here's a here's another image that kind
of explains what we're talking about
here.
That is kind of unreal. I will say that.
I will say that. It's very, very
interesting. What I think is the signal
though is this.
We just saw a 20x FTX level liquidation
event and they couldn't push Bitcoin
under $100,000.
That to me I think highlights
I I would say a smoking gun
because I do think it's interesting that
Black Rockck just saw one of its biggest
it's one of its biggest uh buys in
history. I want to get on to Black
Rockck here in a moment, but uh you know
how I mentioned that altcoin that lost
86% of its value yesterday? Guess who
was all in on it?
You won't believe me. Some of you will
believe me. Ral Paul. Who remembers him?
Wasn't Ral Paul the crypto guru telling
us to go allin NFTts last cycle? He was
saying that Luna was basically
risk-free.
Let's not forget
nearly
nearly his entire liquid portfolio was
in Sooie.
Oh, it will outperform over time. Come
on, guys. Be incredibly careful who you
listen to.
Did Black Rockck just buy $100 million
of sewer yesterday? I don't think so.
But they did buy $5 billion worth of
Bitcoin. Let's get into this because
again it's a big number.
Let's put it into perspective. Is that a
normal buy? Is it normal for Black
Rockck
to execute a $5 billion buy
dur while it was crashing?
Let's put things into perspective. I'm
trying to find
the chart I want to show you.
We know on October 8, just before the
crash,
they bought 3,000 Bitcoin. Black Rockck
did recently get to the 800,000 Bitcoin
milestone. That is, by the way, nearly
4% of the Bitcoin supply.
And this is going to get into the the
theory that we're about to explore in a
moment. We do have an interesting theory
to explore
about Black Rockck. We can see what the
green spike we saw recently was pretty
big. The inflows into Black Rockck's
Bitcoin ETF were big. And again, while
the price has been trending sideways,
look at the uptick from ETFs. Smart
money right now is buying. That's clear.
cards. There's no
hesitation.
Everybody can see that super clearly.
But I mean the more interesting question
arises when we start talking about okay
what's happening here. Was the crash
orchestrated?
Is there something fishy going on? I've
seen a lot of people talk about this. So
I want to break down. It's not a tweet
thread but it's a little bit of a longer
explanation for you guys. This is Jack
Cruz.
We see he's quote tweeting someone's
tweet who's saying, "Wow, don't you
think that's strange? A whale shorted at
the exact peak just minutes before the
Trump the Trump tweet." And you can see
the you we're tracking the whale here.
He literally sold a
minute before the crash. And then all
the green shows that they they closed
their short pretty much exactly at the
bottom.
It's not every day that somebody makes
multiple hundreds of millions of
dollars.
Jack Cruz on Twitter said that my bet is
it was Howard Lutnik and Larry Frink
created the short to see if they
controlled enough bitcoins to make the
market move as it did. It was a
compliance test by the government to
benefit itself. Why? Well, that's the
question. Why? Again, that was the
largest Bitcoin flash crash in history.
$278 billion in value wiped out in 45
minutes. That is a crash the government
can easily track via the blockchain and
apprehend someone. Yes, correct. Why
isn't somebody in handcuffs for market
manipulation? Well, Jack says the reason
no one would be caught is because the
criminals are in DC. They're the ones
doing the crime. Just thought it was an
interesting tweet I'd read out
considering
the size
of the crash. And again, I'm
I'm just saying it's uh coincidental
that Larry Frink just bought 45,000
Bitcoin. Black Rockck accumulated 5
billion worth during the flash crash.
Do you guys think that is a coincidence?
Hm. Just another one of those events
that really makes you question things,
isn't it?
But it's not the only one. I want to go
down a little bit more of a rabbit hole
because of course, let's not forget what
else has happened this week. We've seen
all of the digital ID stuff come out,
distractions.
I'm not so sure.
The only thing I've said with certainty
is that the big money will try to shake
you out of your position. They will try
to shake you out of your Bitcoin. This
is where I want to get into the let's
call it
more somber side
of today's video because I'm sure you
guys have seen a lot of the tweets.
A lot of like seasoned traders with a
ton of money got absolutely wiped
yesterday. We're not talking about
people losing 20K on a leverage long or
we're not talking about somebody losing
even, you know, 200, 300, $400,000.
We're talking about people losing
millions and tens of millions of
dollars.
Like these are serious traders. people
with eight figures
of fiat on an exchange.
A lot of them getting all wiped out.
Again, there is another culprit here.
This is for example just one of the
screenshots from an exchange. These are
the different traders on an exchange.
Look at the top losses. - 59 million, -
35 million, -21 million. These are
enormous losses. Huge
people got absolutely rinsed. And again,
I'll remind you,
wealth is never destroyed.
It transfers hands.
So, a lot of seasoned traders,
they got wiped out yesterday.
But let's not forget that Bitcoin has
moved hands. It's gone somewhere.
This is just yet another example of what
I saw on Twitter. I lost all my money in
Sooie. $15 million lost. The industry is
a scam.
And we can see he went he says he uh I
saw another one of this dude's tweets.
He went from 15 million to $4,000.
They will try to shake you out of your
position.
I don't know whether exchanges are going
to collapse tomorrow, but for me, I
don't if they did, I'm personally
prepared for that situation to happen
and it wouldn't phase me. That's what
Mickey says in the chat. I I agree. Take
your money out now. Again,
it's it's I don't want it to be one of
those days where it's a I told you so
day. It's not about that. Uh but again,
we've been screaming from the rooftops
here on this channel that unless you got
your money in your own self-custody,
you're playing a lot of risk. You're
really engaging in risky business. I
tweeted this out today.
I said, "We've made 13 We've made 1,300
videos on this channel over the past 5
years and literally said the exact same
thing in every video. Do not trade your
Bitcoin. Do not leverage trade your
Bitcoin. Do not trust exchanges with
your Bitcoin.
I get it. People want to make money.
People think they can outperform
Bitcoin. I understand it. But there this
there there should be no world where
somebody loses 15 million because that's
their entire net worth all on one
exchange. Okay? I've told you from day
one if you don't have 90%. I prefer 100%
of your money off an exchange where it
can't be taken in a hardware wallet, I
seriously don't think you own anything.
I think you got paper wealth. I think
the liquidation event we saw yesterday
was proof that unless your Bitcoin is in
one of these, you don't own it. A lot of
these exchanges got absolutely wiped.
Again, just go and buy a hardware
wallet. Does not matter what hardware
wallet you guys want to buy. Just go get
one. Okay. I've personally got the one
I've got in my hand right now. This is
the Treasor Model 5. This is a little
touchcreen hardware wallet. Look at how
compact and small that is. You can tell
I've been using it. Look at those uh
fingerprints and scratches all over the
screen. I I use my hardware wallets. I
like to play around with them. Go and
grab one. Treasor is going to give you
5% off if you buy one and if you use a
promo code Luke. And another hardware
wallet that I think is super easy to
use. It's beginner friendly. Again,
that's what matters here. Beginner
friendly. It's a Ledger. Ledger has a
cool little touchcreen hardware wallet.
You can get a Ledger Stacks, a Ledger
Flex. Uh Ledger is going to give you $10
of free Bitcoin if you use the link down
below in the description. Again, you
don't have wealth if it's sat on an
exchange. the big money is coming for
it. And I honestly just think this is
going to be the first of many
liquidation events. I'm going to show
you a chart looking at all of the
liquidation events in history in a
moment and you're going to see some
really interesting coincidences of what
the markets typically do after these
liquidation events. U but while we're
talking about people taking your money,
again, I think I showed you this guys
maybe a week ago and I said be very very
careful. A lot of people, especially
public Bitcoiners like myself,
you're walking around with a target on
your back. Okay, just be careful. Just
be cognizant. Uh, a lot of people use
multi-IG. Um, sadly, multi- signature
wallet did not protect uh the family
that got kidnapped recently in America.
Uh, you can you guys can see the
headline.
Texas brothers,
they were federally charged recently.
for taking a family hostage. Again, it's
horrific,
but they stole $8 million of crypto.
And what's really fascinating is
they locked up this family for 8 hours.
You can see they walked in with AR-15
style rifles and a shotgun.
And they found out that the the
gentleman who lived there, he must have
owned Bitcoin in a different wallet
somewhere else.
So they actually put the guy in a car.
They drove him 3 hours
so he would go and unlock his entire
Bitcoin wallet. So again, I have multi-
signature wallets. I have keys in
different countries.
So, if somebody wants to do that to me,
they're going to have to put me on a
plane. And I don't keep any Bitcoin on
me personally where I travel. Again, I
have a public YouTube channel talking
about Bitcoin. I would be an idiot to
have any Bitcoin on me.
You might get a $100 off me if you come
and do the same to me, and it could be a
three-hour joy ride. But again, I think
a simple solution to this is something
called time locked Bitcoin wallets.
Multi- signature wallets are cool
because you could have three hardware
wallets, one in three different states
or three different towns. To move
Bitcoin out of a wallet, you have to
sign a transaction from two out of these
three keys. That protects you in a lot
of situations, but not this one that
recently went down in America. This is
why I like time locking hardware
wallets. Uh again, I'd love for you guys
to learn more about time locking, but I
could set up a hardware wallet or a
Bitcoin wallet and I can program when I
allow money to move out of it. It could
be one week, could be a month, could be
a year, could be 10 years. Maybe I want
to pass on my Bitcoin to my kids. Maybe
it's 18 years. You graduate high school,
Bitcoin can be unlocked from this
wallet. I think time locking is not only
really cool from an inheritance
planning, but also from a security
standpoint.
the problem with time locking. Well,
it's above my head, which is why again I
wanted to just let you know about a
great Bitcoin company who creates a
solution to this. This is BitVault. They
have a really easy to use Bitcoin
application that lets you set up a time
locked Bitcoin wallet in minutes. I've
set it up. I've used it. I think they're
an incredible company. I highly
recommend you pay very close attention
to what they're doing right now. They
are under a pre-sale and they're
offering
a $199
lifetime deal. That means you can access
the app forever for $199.
I know originally I told you there was
42 spots available worldwide. I know for
certain there's now less than eight
again after the lifetime pre-sale
forever.
subscriptions
are done. You're going to have to buy a
monthly subscription. I still think it's
worth every dollar if you buy a monthly
subscription in three months time,
but of course, I think you're going to
get a better price if you buy a lifetime
deal. So, I highly recommend you check
out Bit Vault at the link down below
because again, this protects you from
horrific events like this. doesn't just
give you more security and better sleep
at night,
but it protects you. I think it's really
cool as well from an inheritance
standpoint. So, let's talk a little bit
more about where we are in the market.
We're at the stage where I think the big
money is coming and they're going to
want to take your Bitcoin. Again, when
we zoom out, I'll remind you guys,
where's the crash?
I don't see any crash here on the
Bitcoin chart. Sure, that monthly candle
isn't the prettiest, not going to lie,
but I don't think there's any big
horrific crash. I I think we're in
October.
There's some really interesting data
around October. Yes, some of the biggest
crashes in history happen in October.
That's true.
But when you don't see an enormous stock
market crash,
October is generally the it's Bitcoin's
second best month of the year. So, I'll
just remind you of that.
doesn't necessarily mean it's all over
just because we've started on a little
bit of a shaky ground here. We could
come back. Absolutely, we could come
back.
So, the whales are still net short and
bearish.
Pest makes a really good point here in
the comment section. $20 billion
liquidated, but Bitcoin's only down 13%
from the top.
30 to 35% corrections happen a lot.
Be prepared. This is a bull run.
This is a bull run. It is very common to
see
that type of uh correction. Shout out
Mike Hobart.
Longtime friend of the channel. I
haven't spoken to Mike in years, but
he's a great Bitcoiner. Go and follow
him. you should follow him. And we do
need to talk a lot more about physical
security threats. We do talk about a lot
on this channel. We're not just dealers
over here.
Again, there's no I say this all the
time. There's no point being bullish or
watching all of these retire on Bitcoin
videos if you've got money on a
centralized exchange because I can
guarantee you you won't be able to
retire with 0.1 Bitcoin or 100 Bitcoin
if you've got it on an exchange. That's
a promise. Again, not financial advice.
Nothing we say on this channel is
financial advice, but it's
it's a risk. I I wouldn't be watching
any Retire on Bitcoin videos until you
got your Bitcoin in a hardware wallet.
So, go and take care of that ASAP.
Any hardware wallet. Just go and get
one. Please
get a seed signer. Build your own for 20
bucks. It's a little bit over my head,
but
there's solutions for everyone. Doesn't
matter if you got a $100 of Bitcoin in
Africa.
Go get a hardware wallet. $20 hardware
wallet. Build your own.
I'm trying to read all the comments.
Apologies, guys. I want to read all the
comments
before I move on to the next chart I
want to show you.
Again, I I'll just remind you of how
insane. The mainstream media is Forbes
Cascade price warning puts Bitcoin on
the brink ahead of imminent BlackRock
100 billion dollar turning point. Oh
boy.
If you read that headline, you might
fall off your chair until you go and
look at the Bitcoin price. We're down
12%.
Sure. Wow.
Imagine reading that headline. You
haven't paid attention to Bitcoin in
three years. You read that and you
think, "Oh, shoot. How's my retirement?"
You pull up the chart. What?
What are you talking about, Forbes?
You've lost your mind.
Again, I don't care what any shitcoins
are doing. I have no idea what shitcoins
are doing except going to zero. But I do
know I'm pretty sure Bitcoin is still
positive in October.
Let's have a look.
Oh boy, it's been a volatile October.
All right, we're negative. I lied. We
started at 114,000. We're at 109.
But the month is not over.
October is still young, my friends.
October is still young.
And honestly, I'll conclude this video
by saying, who knows what's going to
happen. Maybe Bitcoin crashes further. I
don't know. But I think the crash has
taught us centralized exchanges are a
massive hole. Seeing how illquid they
are and how much wealth was wiped off
them. I will say be very careful if
you're trusting a centralized exchange.
And then a lot of people will say, "But
Luke, how do I buy my Bitcoin?" Uh, I
think there's a lot of solutions.
There's a lot of ways that you can get
your hands on Bitcoin. For example, you
can mine your own Bitcoin. I think a
great place to mine your own Bitcoin is
Blockware. They have hosted mining
solutions or you can buy the mining rigs
yourself directly from them.
I think if you're in America, you
absolutely have to look into mining your
Bitcoin because recently that big
beautiful bill that was passed
allows you to actually invest into
Bitcoin mining and get a 100% tax write
off. Again, as I tell you, nothing you
hear is here is financial advice. I'm
not your tax advisor, but look into it.
Again, if you can get a tax write off
for buying Bitcoin miners and you can
accumulate Bitcoin with the miners
without touching an exchange, that feels
like a no-brainer to me. So again, if
you do want to learn more about that,
book a call with the guys at Blockware.
There's a link down below for you guys
to check them out. Again, learning to
mine your own Bitcoin. It is an
essential tool
in your Bitcoin toolkit.
I will say that
uncle confiscation. I do love that name.
That's interesting. It feels like a
confiscation that again I don't know
what happened yesterday. Maybe Black
Rockck just perfectly timed the bottom.
Again, I'm not saying coincidences can't
happen. I am saying that I think it's
strange that $20 billion of wealth gets
wiped out of the market and Black Rockck
has one of its biggest accumulation days
in a while. That's kind of my summary
here on this video.
A lot of people are saying
this is the beginning of the end. We're
going to see an enormous
stock market crash because a lot of
these stock market crashes have begun in
October. again the first month of Q4.
Are we going to see it again? I don't
know. We could. I don't have a crystal
ball. I don't have a trading course
where I'm going to draw some funny lines
on a chart and tell you to pay me a
$10,000 for a trading course because I
don't know. I have no idea and nobody
does to be honest. Nobody has a clue.
Look at all of the trading gurus on
Twitter who just got wiped out
yesterday. They have no idea.
I'm just showing you all of the data.
I'm going to show you both sides of the
story. You guys can honestly make up
your own conclusion.
I personally think what happened
yesterday was healthy. I think a lot of
liquidity got wiped out. A lot of
leverage got wiped out. It's not just an
opinion. That's a fact. 20 billion of
shorts wiped.
It's nearly 20 times more than 2020.
Look, I'd be surprised if we see the
same thing tomorrow.
That's all I'm going to say on the
matter.
Oh, some of these
some of these some of these comments are
hilarious. 10 $10,000 for a pair of
crystal balls.
Yeah, I'm missing out on a ton of money.
Not scamming people to buy a trading
course. Again, every single partner of
this YouTube channel, they're a partner
I not only use, but I believe in. And
again, I've told you the same thing for
five years, guys. Buy Bitcoin, put it
into self storage. Learn how to back up
your Bitcoin correctly. Again, titanium
plates from Stamp Seed. Listen to it.
It's real titanium. Mining Bitcoin,
borrowing against your Bitcoin
responsibly, and there's a lot of scam
products in the lending space. I
probably am losing a lot of money by not
having a trading course, but I'm not
going to talk about anything I don't
believe in here on the channel.
Which is why I'll tell anyone if you've
got any money left on exchange or if
you're still thinking about leverage
trading this bull run or if you've got
altcoins, reconsider all three of those
positions.
Keep it simple.
Buy more Bitcoin.
And with all that said, I've been
rambling for 43 minutes. I'm going to
end this one here. If you did enjoy this
one, consider subscribing if you want to
be notified when this big mug goes live
again. And with all that said, I might
go live for you guys tomorrow.
Probably will, considering how
interesting the markets are right now.
And with all that said, I wish you a
happy Saturday night. 8:00 where I am.
Have a relaxed Saturday. Don't go too
wild. And I'll see you tomorrow.
