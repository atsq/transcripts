$600 every second, $35,000
every minute, $2 million every hour
since the minute Jesus was born. That's
how long it takes to pay America's
national debt.
>> So basically, nothing stops this train.
For the next 10 years, we're going to be
running very large fiscal deficits in
the US almost regardless.
>> Translation, nothing can save it unless
the whole world decides to chip in $37
trillion. Putin's adviser calls it the
crypto cloud. I'll show you how it
works. The numbers don't just look bad,
they're impossible. How impossible are
we talking about? If you were to gather
all the coins, all the bills from all
around the world, they add up to $8.3
trillion, which means the US owns five
times all the money on Earth. And here's
the kicker. Just the interest payments
alone have gone vertical. Q2 of 2025,
$1.16 trillion dollars a year. That's
before even touching the principle.
Think about that. America now spends
more in interest than it spends on its
entire military. More than the GDP of
most countries, more than Apple,
Microsoft, and Google's profits
combined. So, the math doesn't work. The
debt is not getting repaid. It's only
getting rolled, inflated, and exported.
Which means if the old playbook is
broken, then what's the new one? Here
comes stable coins, dollars in
cryptocurrency rails. And why would
anybody want those? Think of normal
dollars like cars. Well, cars like
dollars could get you almost anywhere
and anything. But they actually have to
follow lanes, stop lights, speed limits,
aka the rules of the banking system.
It's slow, restrictive, and ultimately
it only works if the roads are actually
built. Stable coins are like strapping a
helicopter rotor onto those cars. Same
car, same driver, still the dollar, but
now it can lift off, skip all the
traffic, and fly from point A to point
B. Technically, there is air traffic
controllers who can ground you if they
want, but in practice, it's way more
open and mobile than being stuck on the
road. July 2025, Congress passes the
Genius Act.
>> The Genius Act is a watershed moment in
how we approach digital finance while
also preserving the institutions that
have served our nation for decades.
Digital assets are the future and it is
our responsibility to ensure the United
States continues to lead the way.
>> Which says stable coins like USDC and
USDT must be backed onetoone with US
treasuries or cash. It sounds boring,
right? Here's the trick. Every new
stable coin minted is a direct demand to
US treasuries, aka America's debt, in a
certificate form. The more the world
wants digital dollars, the more US
treasuries and therefore the more debt
America gets to sell. The result,
America pushes its debt onto global
stable coin holders. Inflation turns
from a hidden tax at home onto a shared
cost abroad. The reset button isn't
paying the debt.
>> This time is different.
>> It's spreading it one stable coin at a
time. And this isn't theory. Tedar CEO
told me that himself.
>> We are using the money to buy back the
US treasuries, the US debt. In 2024, we
were the fifth largest purchaser US
treasuries. Today, we hold more than
$125 billion in US treasuries.
>> And the rest of the world, they're
calling BS. At the Eastern Economic
Forum, Putin's advisor, Anton
>> Kovakov,
>> Kovakov, Anton Kovakov, accused the US
of shoving its $ 37 trillion debt into a
crypto cloud, then devalue it at the
world's expense.
Sounds crazy. Not really. We've seen
this movie before. Parallels to US past
rugpool. 1933, FDR revalued gold and
wiped savers overnight. 1971, Nixon
killed the gold standard and broke the
Bretonwoods agreement. So the real
question isn't if the US is going to rug
hole again. The matter is when. But the
thing is, it's already too late. Stable
coins are spreading faster than wildfire
in Argentina, Venezuela, Nigeria,
Brazil. Upwards of 9% of the population
are using stable coins every single
week. And that's on top of stable coin
adoption growing globally 53% per year
because their own money is already
worthless. So they'd rather hold a new
ticking time bomb than one that already
exploded.
>> With USDT, you have 420 million users
and each one of them holds a portion of
US treasuries. So we decentralize the US
D in a way that the US is much less
subject to geopolitical attacks by one
single decision maker that might decide
that US is not its best ally.
Translation: The US just found a way to
quietly push its debt onto the entire
world and the world knows it. Imagine
the world only has $100 and I were to
borrow all of it. Paying it back the
hard way hurts. But if I print another
$100 bill, the prices rise and my old
debt gets easier to pay. That's
inflation. It looks like I repaid, but
in reality, I cheated. Now add stable
coins. You mint tether. The issuer buys
a US Treasury bill. $1 in, $1 out. The
result, a growing ocean of digital
dollars backed by US debt living on
phones from Wenocitis to Laos. So when
delusion happens, the pain is shared
globally. That's the trick. And here's
the crazy part. This isn't just theory.
People are already using Bitcoin and
stable coins together in the real world.
Take Letin for example. They let you
borrow dollar stable coins while using
your Bitcoin as collateral. That means
you don't have to sell your Bitcoin. You
get to keep your upsides while still
getting liquidity in dollars when you
need it. It's like the collision of both
systems. Bitcoin as the hard collateral,
stable coins as the flexible cash. If
you want to check it out, I'll leave the
link below. Now, ask yourself, if stable
coins are digitalized dollars, why are
the issuers buying Bitcoin? Stable coins
were supposed to shore up the dollar.
But they also normalize something
bigger. The idea that money doesn't have
to live in banks. Once billions of
people get used to the idea of digital
dollars on their phone, the leap to a
money that can't be printed, frozen, or
even rugged for is not that far. How
ironic. The same tool built to save the
dollar could be the one to accelerate
its replacement. Meanwhile, the rest of
the world is already moving. China and
Russia are already hoarding gold. Brakes
is already setting up trade systems
outside of the dollar. Countries burned
by US sanctions are desperate to find
any escape patch. So, here's the clash.
America pawns its $ 37 trillion problem
into the cryptocloud, shifting the cost
to hundreds of fragile economies. The
rest of the world doubles down on gold,
bricks, and any other alternative. And
hovering in the middle is Bitcoin,
neutral, borderless, and incorruptible.
So, which future wins? America's digital
dollar cryptocloud, a bricksled gold
block, or a money with no master at all?
You tell me.
