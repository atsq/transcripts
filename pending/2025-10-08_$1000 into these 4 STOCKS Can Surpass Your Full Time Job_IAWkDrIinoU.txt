Right now, while most investors are
chasing the same overpriced tech stocks,
four under the radar opportunities are
setting up for potentially explosive
moves. That's what Winston just said to
me. He's in charge of sniffing around
stocks, large nose and all that. But
we're literally talking about a Bitcoin
miner trading 25% Wall Street's target,
a biotech stock with zero debt and lots
of cash and a farmer giant with a
blockbuster drug growing very rapidly.
and a rare earth lithium play trading at
just a third of its book value. By the
end of this video, you know exactly
which four stocks these are, why they're
positioned to potentially surge the
exact price levels where smart money is
getting in as well. My name is Felix
Pri. I'm an exin investment banker. That
was Winston back there. And I'm also the
founder of Goat Academy where we've
helped over 20,000 students so far and
the co-founder of tradevision.io bio
where we make Wall Street level data and
news available to you. So today I'm
going to break down four stocks across
different sectors. Cryptomining,
biotech, pharma, and lithium. Why?
Because I see these sectors as the ones
most likely to rally over the coming
weeks. No meme stocks here, just real
companies or real catalysts trading at
prices that probably won't last. Now,
before we dive in, here's how this
works. I'm going to give you the ticker,
the exact entry price, the capitalist
driving it, and why Wall Street is
positioning for upside. I'll also show
you the risks because every trade has
them, and how to size your position
intelligent intelligently for that, if I
can pronounce that word. So, let's start
with the most explosive sector right
now, Bitcoin mining. The first stop
stock on our list is ticker symbol CLSK,
CleanSpark.
It's a Bitcoin mining play that is on
fire. Bitcoin smashed through $125,000
all new alltime high and all of that.
And it's a gamecher for miners. Why?
Because when Bitcoin rallies, minor
profitability explodes. They're
producing the same amount of Bitcoin,
but each coin is worth way more. And
this isn't some fly by night operation,
by the way. They brought in $344
million in revenue the first half of
this year. That's real money, real
scale. And even Wall Street sees it. And
those guys are not exactly super bullish
on on on uh crypto, but even they, this
is a stock trading here at $15. They
have a $20 plus price target on this.
And if you look at the chart here, you
can see it's been popping. And you might
be thinking, oh, therefore, it must be
too late. No, actually it's just a bad
right
because yes, the stock is rallying up
here quite nicely. But you see that it's
rallying up here quite nicely. But what
we actually want is a stock in a rally
because this thing went up, it went
down, it went up, it went down. And now
it's breaking out of that resistance
here. It's gapping up and it's looking
just beautifully. And if you look at the
volume at the bottom of the screen,
flat, flat, flat, flat, flat, heartbeat,
right? So there is actually some money
flowing into this and that isn't random.
That's institutional money starting to
position. So when you see volume spikes
with price going up, that is your signal
that smart money is accumulating. So
what's the entry strategy here? I'd love
for this to pull back. I'd honestly love
for this to pull back and retest the
recent highs, which are basically at 15
bucks. That would be my sweet spot
entry. I might not get that. So, if
instead it actually breaks out above the
recent high here, which would be about
$16.50,
I'm also very happy to buy it on the
rally because if Bitcoin holds above
$120,000,
we got some really, really, really good
room towards 20 bucks plus here. Bitcoin
of course is volatile, right? Miners get
crushed if it drops. So, it is a
momentum play. You're betting on Bitcoin
strength. you're getting more reward
than in Bitcoin. So, what's the key
here? Well, don't go all in on some
Bitcoin miner, right? So, what we're
going to do here is, and again, I'm not
telling you what to do. This is a
hypothetical thing. And you see, we're
playing with $1,000 here. Not something
that'll bankrupt most people. So, for
me, put a quarter of the money into
this. $250,
not for you, but for me. And therefore,
we're risking, yes, 25% here. This is
aggressive, but it's manageable. of the
other three stocks balance out the risk.
Now, maybe you want to learn the exact
system to find the setups like this
before they explode. In which case, I'm
going to run a free training for you
where I will teach you how Wall Street
finds winning stocks and how it uses AI
to do so more and more and how to use
those tools yourself on Tuesday 9:00
p.m. Eastern time at felix.org/training.
And if I look at some of the stocks
we've picked and actually done YouTube
videos on, so this is real public proof.
I also do others obviously that we don't
do YouTube videos on. We're doing pretty
nicely here on the gains. And by the
way, the only big loss here, we never
allow a 30% loss. Again, that's just
called risk management. But we have a
lot of lot of really really really nice
winners here on that list. And this is
just this is just the last two weeks,
right? You go back down and you see a
lot more of those. That's basically what
we do here. We look for good stocks. So
the link is down below in the
description. Befriend/training.
Grab yourself a free seat and be on
time. Now let's move on to stock number
two which Winston still sniffed out and
this is a biotech stock. There's
probably one sector they love above all
X sectors right now and it's biotech.
This stock is called Oric O R I C O or
pharmaceuticals. It's an oncology
focused biotech and oncology is
dominating the whole biotech dealmaking
space in 2025. So a huge chunk of total
biotech M&A volume and value flowing
into these cancer drug companies. Well,
it's into these kind of stocks. Why?
Because cancer treatments are where the
big pharma money is going. It's the
hottest space in healthcare apparently.
And Oric is different from 90% of
biotechs, which are just batched crazy
high-risisk plays. These guys have 283
million in cash
and they have zero debt, so they're
going to survive. Most biotechs are
burning cash, diluting shareholders
every quarter. These guys instead have a
runway for years. What can they do
without money? Well, they can do their
clinical trials. They can
basically create drugs and value without
begging investors for more money. And
that's generally speaking where you want
to be. What about the Wall Street lot?
Well, eight of the 10 Wall Street
analysts covering covering this actually
have a buy rating on this stocks trading
at $11.50 and the average price target
is $1729.
Now, that's the target. That's the Now,
I don't pay that much attention to world
street price targets, but I know some
people do. It's a 40% upside, right? But
the technical setup is actually very,
very, very good. once again. So, it's a
textbook setup
where the stock has consolidated here
since July. It's basically
pulled back pretty harshly, but it
recovered back up above this yellow line
here. This 50-day moving average line
bounced back up. It's now retracing and
it's giving us that kind of sweet spot
to get in on this before it takes out
the recent highs that we've seen in July
and once again in October. So what's the
catalyst? Well, they're advancing
multiple oncology programs. Any positive
clinical trial data could send this
thing into a parabolic move because the
beautiful thing with bioteex is they
move very very quickly. This thing was
once trading at $40, right? four times
higher. So the risk, the trial fails,
stocks get hammered. If it succeeds, it
could double or triple your money
overnight. And that's basically it. So
what am I looking at? I'm looking at
taking out the recent highs here at sort
of $12 and a bit. So somewhere like 1220
or something like that going to get in
on. Hopefully we're going to see the re
the institutional volume follow which is
that confirmation that we want. And if
you want to be a bit more cautious on
this, well, wait for it to go to 13 and
watch for the volume. You're a little
bit late, but you're much safer, right?
What about risk management? Well, again,
it's all about position sizing. If you
spread your money about across different
sectors, yes, you're still going to have
some risk and we might want to set some
stops on this like everything else. But
if we again just put a quarter of this
magical two $1,000 into this, you're
betting on clinical success, maybe M&A
potential, but you're also expecting
that, yeah, it could go down minus 20%.
Right? In which case, well, you haven't
lost that much because you only put a
quarter into it, so your overall loss is
5%. And that's biotech. It's high risk.
It's potentially high reward. I think
this is the golden era of biotech for
the what next couple of months. So, we
got one more, but this one is a lot more
of a safer play. This is called
Regenerine Pharmaceutical. Ticker symbol
is Regn. Pretty sure I've talked about
this before. Let me see if it's on our
list here. Nope, it isn't. Okay, maybe I
just bought it before. Um, this is a
large cap biotech. So, this isn't some
teeny tiny, you know, working out of a
garage kind of a setup. It's a big big
company. They're innovating. They're
growing. And they're not dependent on
one drug. They have a blockbuster drug
called Dupixent.
I don't take any drugs at all. By the
way, if you know what these things
really truly are, if you're on them, let
us know in the chat. Um sales on this
thing are up 23% yearonear, which is
which is pretty good. Bringing in almost
$4 billion in the last quarter. $4
billion in one quarter from one drug.
And these guys just got approved for a
new illness. Well, maybe not a new
illness, but it newly got approved for
COPD, which is a massive new market,
potentially billions more in revenue
over the next few years. So, this isn't
one of those, you know, hope and prey
biotech. This is a cash machine. And
Wall Street also sees the potential
trading at $600. Wall Street has a price
target of, wait for it, $1,000
53.
Yes, $2 in that sentence. So that's some
some pretty significant upside about 70%
upside. And yeah, you know, analysts are
mostly um numbuts uh you know, sheep and
all that, but even if they're a little
bit wrong, we could still be looking at
some nice upside here. So it's a kind of
riskreward that makes good sense for a
large cat. But there is more. They have
another drug which is called li
that's also grown to almost $300 million
just in the last quarter. another growth
driver maybe, but I'm not aware of. So,
you've got multiple growth drivers,
multiple stocks, not one product, and
yes, a pipeline. So, what's the entry
strategy here? For me, it's just taken
out the recent highs here. So, something
like a
620 entry. Um, I'd also nibble on it on
a pullback as it hits our 50-day moving
average line because that's been a
pretty good strategy so far. It's going
to be less volatile than most of the
other biotechs out there. So once again,
allocation to this in my hypothetical
portfolio is $250 as in a quarter of the
money that's lying about. Risk is lower,
but the upside is still pretty
significant. And then stock number four,
and this one's really exciting, lithium
from the good old co days. This is one
of those. The tick symbol is
Lithu Argentina, land of silver. ticker
symbol is L.
Not to be mixed up with LAC or one of
those. It's L. Why does it matter? Well,
lithium mining is the backbone of the EV
revolution. And yeah, I know there's all
sorts of new technology, but at the
moment, we still need tons of of lithium
and demand for battery metals is growing
as EVs and grids scale projects, storage
projects, batteries are becoming the
thing. So, if you believe electricity is
the future, you basically need some
lithium. Now, here is what's actually
insane about them. L is trading at 0.36
times its book value. What does that
mean? The accountants think it's worth
three times more than um what it's
trading out, which is
a massive discount. So, it's a deep
value play. You're basically
paying 36 cents and you are potentially
getting a dollar. So if lithium prices
rebound just modestly, this baby could
rip bigly. See where I'm learning my
English, right? URL Presidente. And
they're doing really well, by the way.
They're ramping up production, 18%
growth year on year. Costs are dropping,
higher output, lower costs. That's kind
of essential if you're in mining. So
what do analysts think on this? Analysts
essentially are saying the lithium
prices are bottomed out. And that's what
we're seeing here because this thing was
trading way, way, way higher, right? But
buy and hold, they say, right? Buy and
hold. Yes, buy and hold. Imagine you
bought this at the top of the market in
2021. Well, you'd only be down 89%. Buy
and hold a little bit longer and you'll
be dead. Uh, but if it just recovers
somewhat, we could be looking at like a
couple of hundred% returns. So, when
lithium prices start picking up again,
and most people that I talk to think
we're somewhere near the bottom, then um
well, we've seen the movie before. We've
seen it with oil. We've seen it with
copper. We've seen it with gold. We're
seeing it with silver. The commodity
cycle is what? It's a cycle. And miners
amplify that move. So, potentially we
make more money. So, what's my my in
here? I'd love for this to pull back a
little bit just because it's such a
volatile stock. And and if you look at
how it moves up and down, up and down,
up and down, up and down, up, right? So
somewhere in that $3.70 range, something
like $3.70, that would be kind of my
sweet spot entry. Why? Because I like to
buy this on a little bit of a discount
or me. It's a bit of a longerterm play
on lithium. You could of course also buy
it as it goes lower. Watch the 50-day
moving average line, though. That's kind
of your key support. And if it really
just breaks out above the recent highs
here, then that's equally good. But it's
a speculative play. So again, you uh
want to be careful and cautious. You
don't want to put all your money into
it. So that's why again, we're putting a
quarter of this mythical thousands into
this betting on a commodity rebound and
execution and the fact that Wall Street
is loving it because that down there, my
friend, is Wall Street buying our stock.
So it's an asymmetric play where we
potentially have a three or 4x
opportunity. So, how do we put this all
together then? Let's do a little bit of
learning here. So, we got our $1,000,
right? And what are we doing? We're
allocating them across four stocks. So,
we've got some of it in essentially
Bitcoin, CLSK, right? But a minor play
on Bitcoin. We have some of it in a pure
play
biotech because biotech is what's
booming. And then we have another
quarter of it in REGGN which is a large
cap more stable growth anchor. And then
we have our fourth quarter in Lithium
Argentina. Now of course you don't have
to buy these things. These are just the
basis of your research. But we're
diversified across sectors, market caps,
risk profiles. You got crypto exposure,
biotech, farmer, commodities. So if one
sector gets crushed, the others can
offset the damage. Even if two of these
hit their target, we're looking at some
serious gain. So the key is always don't
blow up your account chasing one stock.
Equal waiting forces discipline. You're
not betting the farm on a single idea.
And if one stock starts working, you can
add to it with profits from the others.
And then of course, very very
importantly, I always preach this, we
set stops. stop losses. Now, these are
high up risk plays. So,
you could have your your stop loss at
10%, maybe you want to set it at 20% or
somewhere in between. Or maybe you want
to actually learn how to do properly on
a chat, in which case you got to join
one of my live sessions link down below.
But you do want to set one. You don't
want to leave leave it up to your
emotions because they're going to screw
you over. So, we've got Bitcoin at an
all-time high. So, miners benefit. We've
got biotech M&A recovering massively
benefits Oric. We got farmer innovation
uh which is just tremendous for
Regeneron. And then we got lithium
bottoming out which could be really good
for AR. But we are in a market where
sector rotation is happening very very
fast. Money is flowing from overvalued
tech and into undervalued growth in
commodities. And these four stocks are
in my presently favorite sectors. You
