[Music]
[Applause]
shall soon.
Ladies and gentlemen, the time is here.
The new journey, monumentous day. We are
about to start our first sports show.
And I say show because we've never
watched a live action TV show about
soccer or sports. So, I'm actually very,
very excited. We know Blue Lock is about
soccer. Yeah, that's all we know. We are
actually g especially when we first
started watching anime. This was one of
the shows I had already kind of heard
about because obviously I played soccer.
We've all played soccer. It was also a
big thing during the World Cup. Um the
previous World Cup. Yeah. When Japan was
going crazy. So crazy. Season one of
this was going on. I remember all my
friends like, "Oh, you played you should
watch this." So, as you can see, we've
all got our jerseys on. Oh, not our
jerseys, but us three got Real Madrid.
This is This is my Thailand club from
when I played back in the day over
there. Yeah. And then So, we've all got
a soccer background. All of us. We've
all played. None of us unfortunately
made it professional. That's why we're
sitting here today. Yeah, exactly. But
we some of us are pretty close, right?
It might be a blessing in disguise.
Correct. So on that note, we'll give you
guys a little montage. So in three, two,
one.
[Music]
So hopefully your eyes are blessed.
Okay.
Just just a little sneak peek maybe as
we as you go along the show. We'll show
you more skills as we keep going in this
room in this background. You'll get more
footages, but for now that's all we're
giving you guys. But on a little bit
more of a serious note, we're super
excited and let's just we do this before
every show, but what are we hoping to
see and what do we think we will see?
I'll I'll go first. Yeah. Obviously, we
know it's about soccer. So, I'm I'm
thinking maybe do they follow one one
person and it's like his journey of
making it to a professional soccer club
or if it's like a team and how that team
goes. I I wouldn't I wouldn't mind if
it's either. My my my initial thoughts
is like if you've played FIFA, everyone
knows the journey, right? Yeah, I think
it's about Alex Hunter, Alex Hunter. I
think it's about one player and his
journey through soccer. I think this is
more like these guys. These players
actually have supernatural abilities on
the on the pitch. It's not actually like
anime. Yeah, cuz it's an anime. They're
going to integrate some of that in there
and it's going to be about the team
trying to win the championship. I
actually hope it's not too much about
like supernatural per se. Like if it's
obviously amplified, that's fine. But I
think yeah, I'm expecting more of like a
come up with a team kind of thing.
Everyone's going to have different
abilities. Like this guy can jump this
high and super Exactly. Super short.
Yeah. And then you've got like drama and
stuff within the team.
So good. It's like it's like guys like a
guy he's being distracted by a girl like
you teammate sleeps on another member's
girl. But overall super excited. So
obviously we're going to be ahead on our
Patreon. So if you want to check that
out, check that out. It will be uncut
and early access. And obviously we got
all our other shows. So check that out
if you
want.
[Music]
behind the grass looks. Oh, he chopped
the grass.
This animation's sick. It's like a
cartoon. It looks different. Yeah, real
life.

Don't pass it, bro. Shoot yourself. No.
Pass it. Do not play self. He's open. He
can score. You have to sweat.
Team. Oh, okay. I like that.
That's respectable. But he's going to
miss it. I don't You can't always trust
your teammates, bro. It's an open goal.
Oh, this is why you don't trust your
mates. Should have believed in himself.
Nationals, man. Nationals.
That look like
Ri High School going up against each
other.
Oh no. Of course. What a goal. Because
of that top right. Oh shoot. Lost
because he sweat it to his teammate.
It's all right. It's part of the game,
boys. It's part of the game.
Oh, he's in.
The jewel of Japanese.
[Music]
Oh, wow. That's probably his arch
nemesis.
Good response. Media train. Yeah, he's
PR training.
Yeah. Is he just saying that or does he
believe it? I think he's just saying
that for the media. He might actually
mean it.
Oh, this means a lot, man. It's like
when you lose a big game.
Oh, yeah. He's the only one not crying.
I think she was
anger. The reality. This animation is
really good. I'm already loving this.
He's unknown. I hope we go on his
journey, bro.
He's doing it for someone else. France
alleviate you. Oh, this is best player.
Okay.
Oh, that's probably made you want to
start playing. We all like that. This is
relatable, man. Literally, I'm like
watching this. This is relatable as
hell.
[Music]
That's why he passed it as well. Hearing
that the
team wants to be okay. World Cup.
Imagine World Cup
[Music]
regret that this is going to play in his
head for ages. That's what he could have
done. Yeah. And he would have been after
like meeting with him. Yeah, exactly.
Now he can't think like that though.
Like game's done. Yeah, but it's hard
man.
[Music]
That co's going to hurt you forever.
Damn. Damn. That is Bro, that's
powerful, bro. I'm already watching this
and I'm already feeling this. Yeah. Now
he lets it all out. Not in front of
everyone. Yeah. He comes home like
nothing happened. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Nothing now.
Yeah, scouts have been looking at him.
Maybe he got drafted. That work scouted.
[Laughter]
He got picked for Japan. Yeah. What?
Yeah, he got picked for Japan. That's
crazy. Boy Union. Maybe he should
have. Who doesn't? Facts. He's asking
he's a superstar. I like you,
but he's already assuming that he'd pass
to him. Exactly. He does seem sincere
though. I was going to say I feel like
there's something underlying there
that's not sincere.
I think he's a genuine person. Is this
like an academy or something? I think
so. I think it's a Japanese.
Yeah. I love that he's giving him his
props. Like even though your team did
well is nice. Yeah, he's good and he's
nice. Daniel,
it's going to be a battle for positions.
Yep. Twins. That's a lot of people. Holy
[ __ ] Same school. Listen, this tri
always so
intimidating.
[Music]
Like diamonds in the rough.
They're all strikers. They're all
strikers just for one position. Bro,
randomly I kind of see where the show is
going. Ginachi, who's going to be the
striker to represent the country?
Yeah. What is that? Oh, yeah. You need
someone to score
goals. Daniel World's best. One of 300.
[Music]
show is
about sick. I am excited for this show.
This is going to be crazy. I'm excited
for this show. Let's go home. You live
and breathe
soccer. Only one can
survive. The last man stands at soccer
hunger games. Literally,
it's like every kid's dream, man. Facts.
Holy. Not going to be easy, though. Come
on. I already want to binge this, bro.
He's talking about the World Cup. You
got to represent your country, bro. But
he's got a point. He can't abandon his
team.
He's like he's not speaking up though.
Exactly. He wants this. This is the best
option he's going to get.
[Music]
Lock
[Music]
off more important than winning the
World Cup. Exactly. Talk about winning
the World Cup. World's best striker.
They're implying singular and the
nationals imply
[Music]
team. That's what he's been asking
himself. Yeah, that's literally what
he's
questioning. being your own best
[Music]
player. Now, we got a cynical look to
it. That guy's name is Ego. Remember,
his name's
Ego. Damn.
Damn. He's speaking fact. It's an
interesting perspective. There's two
Yeah. There's two sides.
Yeah. Only a Japanese player I know is
Honda.
Okay.
[Music]
Journey. I kind of see that Ronaldo.
[Music]
He won the door. Okay. Okay. I don't
know if that's
possible. We'll take it. Erica,
let me pop my collar, lad. Let me pop my
collar. Let me pop my
[Music]
collar. Will's best forward, midfield,
and
goalkeeper. Fair enough. That's a
bell's real name is Alanis Mento.
[Music]
Egoist. Yeah.
Where they put themselves first.
Damn. I kind of see that. I understand
it to be a striker. Or a striker. Yeah.
Especially a
striker champion.
But he agrees with it.
I think you need a balance. Yeah, you
do.
[Music]
imposter. This is where you start
though. I'm imagining
it. They're cheering your name
and you score the winner.
We've all dreamed about this 100%. Wait,
this is literally what you're having
with him. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, exactly.
Oh,
true. You have to score. Yeah.
Yes, this first episode. This is sick.
There's such an interesting perspective
on this whole thing. It's so relatable.
Yeah.
[Music]
Yeah. Well, there's something brewing
inside this, man. Oh, what a what a
start. He's taking the step. He's
taking the step. He's going in, baby.
That little blue light they have in his
eyes.
Yeah. Jump in there.
Yeah. Oh, he's gone. Look at all these
people. They all want one position, bro.
He gave a mean speech, man. Shout out
Ego, man. Ego was really
egotistical started.
[Music]
It's literally the top of the mountain,
so you can't even leave. It's just an
abandoned building. Oh my days, bro.
What a start. This has got to be a real
life, man. This is peak. No intro,
nothing. Straight in. Straight in. Crap.
Yeah. There's going to be a lot of
characters, bro. Oh, look at the way
they're looking at him.
Oh, he's with
Kira. That's good.
Oh, the games have already started.
Bro, he's
What the hell? Is he sleeping?
Dreaming second
year. They keep calling
him and your
enemies. Okay.
Hello. It's a random
advice decision
making. Oh, he's second
last. Damn. The other guy's 300. The
other one's
300. This is
interesting.
Okay.
Oh, the academy. Okay. Love that. I love
that.
Yeah, they're still young. They can't
just kicked out.
Damn. What the hell? That is cool.
They're testing their
tag. She kick people. Yeah, I think you
have to kick it at people.
Yeah. All right. It's just foot skills,
bro. Just straight into it. Okay. He's
in. Oh, number 300 is
first barefoot as
well. He's going to play for Japan.
That's cool, bro. That's a lot of
pressure. This is high stakes and a lot
of pressure. the first activity.
He's kicking, man. Oh, he's going for
him cuz he's second weakest. He needs to
level up the ranking.
He's probably one of the best players
here, too. Yeah, it has to be.
Oh, yeah. Hit. Yeah, hit that guy.
That's cheap. We should be sleeping.
What the hell? So, you can do that. What
the his hand. Yeah. No hands.
He's just waking up. Yeah, bro. This
guy. Okay.
What's his rank? I want to see this
guy's rank, man.
That's what you get for playing fair.
There's no fair here when you're going
one spot and there's 300 of you. Just
291.
[Music]
That's not fair. Damn, they have power.
Straight to his stomach. Come on.
Come on. 1 minute 30, bro. He's like,
he's got this. Walk in, bro. That's
cool, bro. If you put it like that,
that's all your dreams are just gone.
[Music]
More power. Dribble close to
somebody. Kick it, bro. Hit him, bro.
So his bad,
bro. That drive. Kick it. Please tell me
you don't go.
He's just holding him.
I don't think he's going to hit him.
That's unfair. I don't think he's going
to take it either. I don't think he's
going to take it. Oh, you need ego.
Remember what he said.
Time out. Oh, his ankle.
Oh, is this fair or not? He's saying you
got to do it. Is that ego? I don't know.
Yeah, this is really ego. It's his dream
or the other person's dream. I don't
think he takes it. It's kill or be
killed. I think he has to do it. Yeah,
he has to do it. He has to. It's be
killed or kill. Yeah. You can't think
this other person's career. You have to
think about your own. That's
ego. Oh, that blue thing is blue flame
is so sick.
Oh, that
[Music]
took you accept it. I don't think he's
just going to do it. I don't either. He
didn't.
Oh, he stood by his principle. One for
all. All for one.
But he wants to change. Wait. Yeah.
Wait. What?
Okay. I got goosebumps. Holy crap. Oh,
he's not wake up. He's not going for
anyone. Wake up.
[Music]
Wait, he took took the ball. The
strongest one. This guy's just like
chaotic. He's 29.
Oh, he jumped over it.
He's trying to head kick him.
Bicycle. He's going to pl
[ __ ] Is that going to hit him? No, I
don't think he is.
No way. He's like he's going to do it.
He's going to
think
[Music]
it's bro. Teamwork makes the dream work,
baby. Holy crap.
That is ego. Oh my god.
That's how you show ego. That's actually
how you show ego. It's not by picking on
the weak. That was sick. What? What a
first episode.
[Music]
Additional
time. Facts. Facts.
[Music]
You got to earn that [ __ ]
[Music]
boy. That's relatable as hell,
man. It's always the news,
[Music]
bro. He's really obsessive.
[Music]
He would have been nothing otherwise.
That was a great first episode, man.
Holy genuinely. Oh, that might be
arguably the best first episode of all.
You reckon? I think so. Entertainment.
It's up there. It's 100% up there. Oh,
you know, you know this common theme of
anime, but they always just get straight
into it. Even this, they gave us the
message and the what it's going to be
about and we kind of see, all right, we
see from the how they started it. Do you
follow your your own dreams and be a bit
selfish or do you live for the team? The
whole ego thing is so beautiful. I
actually Yeah, it's that's my favorite
part about this episode. It's like the
show takes such a different take on it.
It's like even what is literally said,
he's like, "Oh, this isn't common
sense." Like this goes against common
sense. But he's like, it's so different.
Like there's something about element of
truth in it. He's trying to forge the
mind of a champion. That's what this
show is about. It's trying to show you
what the mind of a champion looks like,
right? I think Isakagi is a perfect
character to have that as show that
through as well because he's so novice.
He's so like he doubts himself. He's a
he's a massive self-doubter, right? And
seeing that mindset crystallize into
something greater, that's the greatest
experience we're going to have sitting
here. My thing is I don't think he
doubts his ability. I just don't think
he doubts the the fundamentals of the
game and stuff like that. That's why you
talk about ego. It's such a beautiful
path cuz it's like it's different path
for him now. All right. He doesn't need
to doubt. Oh, should I pass? Should I
not pass? Should I do it's one way and
one way which he thinks can get him to
his goal, right? There's there's two
ways I'm looking at this. Number one is
ego, the the main guy. He's advocating
for all right, you got to do everything
to be the best striker so Japan wins,
right? you're thinking about a
destination where in reality what soccer
is about is your team, the camaraderie
you build. But he's literally like screw
that just go for this one big goal. And
the thing the problem with that is
sometimes you don't enjoy the journey.
But what that last scene of that this
episode showed me was you can still get
to that end goal by working as a team.
Yeah, exactly. That's I was thinking
that too cuz between that guy and work
together. They work together. Exactly.
So it's like, oh my. And the fact that
they're in this environment where it's
like, oh, you either win or you never
get to play for Japan. So it's like
they'll literally pull out everything
they have in order to become the best
version of the I can already I can
already see people like snaking each
other because they want it. But I think
the people who will propel and win at
the end of the day will because they
pick five people, right? If you work
together, you are five a team of five
work together, you can make it through
together. And then after that, whatever
happens after that, but I can already
sense like beef amongst people, like
people being snaky. So, I think the
addition of characters like Kira as
well, that's also another big thing cuz
you can see even though he's probably
one of the best players there, he was
the best there. He's against it. He's
he's against the whole idea of being the
number one and oh, I have to be better
than everyone else. He still puts the
team above anything, right? So, it's an
interesting charact like it's an
interesting character to introduce. I
hope we see Kira's journey. Like surely
not. It's the f like if you don't make
out. Yeah. Like surely there's some
stipulation there. Like he can become a
goalkeeper and go to Japan. Like
of the show like I want to see his feel
connected the characters, bro. The fact
that he's like what he said there, bro.
That was sick. Him like going for the
weakest. I did not expect that. Was it
that yellow the guy with yellow hair was
like let's go for the strongest. And he
knew to fast. Exactly.
The only way he's going to get better is
by going for stronger people. But but do
you think that feeds into what ego
wanted from people as well? Yes, that's
exactly what ego wants. Exactly what he
wants. Which is a good thing or a bad
thing? You think you think there's a I
think there's a part of me right because
ego advocates for this your individual
everyone by themselves screw the team. I
think though he's actually going to be
inspired by how these guys within blue
lock they work as a team. He might
actually change his stance as well. I
see a bit of that. I see. But I think
what they let me go, let me go. What
they're talking about is only a striker.
They're talking about purely a striker,
right? So it's like I kind of get where
they're coming from. If you just have a
striker who's playing up top by himself,
doesn't need wingers, like then they use
the example that French guy Eric Anthony
Pelle like I kind of get where he's
coming from with that. I think Ego is
double layered in what he's in his
messaging. I think his front is like,
okay, you got to be this one singular
best champion in the team. But I think
behind the the scenes in his heart, he's
like, "All right, I'm trying to find
that one person that can show me
otherwise." I think that's what he I
actually think it's what Rowan said.
It's like Ego knows like he's pushing
this individualism, right? But I think
at the end of the day, he knows what's
behind that, which is teamwork. Like the
teamwork we saw there, I think Ego is
expecting that as well. So, I think he's
trying to build that up like cuz
ultimately you still got to be a bloody
good player to win. Individuals will
make a good team. Exactly. Exactly.
Exactly. But bro, what an episode. I'm
so keen. Let's rate the first episode. I
would honestly give it like a because
it's so relatable as well. I don't know.
I don't think in life you can give
anything a 10. So, I will give this a
9.9. For me, I'm like one of my
favorite. I wish I watched this early in
life. I was going to say 9.8. Sorry, my
mind went blank. I was going to say 9.8.
I'll give it a 9.5. I'll give it a 9.3.
Fair enough. I'll give you 9.3.
