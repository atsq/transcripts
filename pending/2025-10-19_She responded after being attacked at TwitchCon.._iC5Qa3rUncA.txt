I don't know if you guys can see this. I
wrote [ __ ] notes for this because
there's so much stuff that I feel like I
needs to be talked about, which is also
why I was very aggressive in my tweet
earlier today, which is I mean, you guys
know me. I am never like that.
>> But I feel like in a way it's my
responsibility. You know what I mean?
>> You got lied about and if you don't say
something, they'll do it to somebody
else. This could have happened to
anyone. Honestly, for all we know, this
could have already happened to someone,
a small streamer,
>> and someone just wasn't filming it.
>> It did in other other years.
>> Okay, I'll just I'll just start this by
saying shout out to the guy who filmed
it and put it on Twitter.
>> Yeah,
>> because last night after this happened,
I was thinking like, [ __ ] like, I have
to talk about this. Like, people need to
know that this happened. Like, how am I
going to do that? And then someone
happened to post it on Twitter. So,
thank [ __ ] god I I didn't have to
figure that out myself. Um, which, okay,
like I said, this is going to be a mess
because I'm not meant to be doing these
kinds of streams.
>> This is why I always did all the OTK
addressing drama streams.
>> Don't think that Twitch would have put
out an official statement if that clip
wasn't posted and going viral.
>> Of course not. And even after the fact
that that clip was posted and going
viral, I as far as I know, the other
people who had meet and greets today
were not reached out to to ask if they
wanted extra security or if they even
wanted to cancel their meet and greet.
>> That's interesting.
>> And maybe some people were, but um I
know for a fact Extra Emily wasn't.
>> Um my person, she's like a huge female
creator. Extra security. No one reached
out to her. Don't know about everyone.
>> Oh my god.
>> Fact.
>> Okay. So,
>> of all the people,
>> let's just start from the beginning
because I want to have be able to run
through everything before the show
starts. The show starts in a [ __ ]
hour.
Okay. Um, my notes are a [ __ ] mess.
It looks like a skitso board. Um,
but yeah, again, thank you to the guy
that put it on Twitter. Thank you to the
people that talked about it because
otherwise I don't know if anything would
have been done or would have been taken
seriously straight up.
So I'm just going to go through from my
perspective what happened what I saw the
order of events. Um, so I was doing my
meet and greet and I've seen people
saying that it was an obligation given
to me, uh, like to be a featured creator
and to have my show, I had to do a meet
and greet,
>> which is true. I was told that I had to
do a meet and greet.
>> Um, but as far as I know, there are some
people that canled
>> regardless. I didn't. They told her that
she had to. I'm going to be fine.
>> So, um, I show up at 4. I'm doing my
meet and greet.
Um,
this happened about 30 minutes into my
meet and greet. So, I was probably only
like 20 to 30% done with my meet and
greet.
Um,
I was just taking a picture with someone
else, like completely normal, nice.
>> When's your meet and greet? Um, and then
I see out of the corner of my eye,
there's a guy
>> walking around the side of the meet and
greet and he crosses in front of the
meet and greet of the person to the left
of me. That's what I was telling you,
>> which is a Btuber. So, he he's able to
walk up and in front of another
streamer's meet and greet
>> and then he walks up to me and he he's
like walking with a purpose, you know
what I mean? Um,
and he he grabs me, but I'm like, "Wait,
what the fuck?" Like, but in in my head
I'm like, it's it seems like he's
supposed to be here. And then he leans
and like he's going to tell me
something.
>> So, in my head I'm like,
>> maybe it's like Twitch staff like coming
to let me know something cuz like
>> sometimes that'll happen
>> where you're at an event and someone
come up to like let you know something.
You know what I mean? Um,
but I'm still like freaked out because
he grabbed me. That's not normal. And
then he grabs my face and he leans in
and lips puckered and tries to kiss me
and I start screaming. You can't hear it
in the clip, but I'm [ __ ] screaming
my head off. And then my security,
>> Twitch's security is like nowhere near
me, nowhere to be found. I can see them,
but they they don't do anything.
>> It's cosmetic security. Um, my security
jumps up and shoves the guy away from me
and is like, "Get the [ __ ] out of here."
>> Yeah.
>> And he's allowed to walk away and leave.
Um, yeah. So then after this point, I
did not see a lot of what happened here.
This is just based off what people in
the line told me. Uh, my friend Bonnie
who was there told me and Melissa, my
manager told me.
>> So the the woman who moved me away from
the means was my personal manager. That
was not Twitch staff. No one in Twitch
staff came up to me to like see what was
going on.
>> How convenient.
>> Uh my manager and Bonnie moved me to the
back and they're like hugging me and
being like, "Uh, do you want to finish
your meet and greet?" basically. Um
and I I was back there for like a minute
and I was like, "You know what? Like I I
want to finish it cuz like of all these
people here that you know,
they're just nice normal people." And I
go back out there and still there's no
one from Twitch there. And the poor guy
that I was taking the picture with
originally, he he looks he's he's like
[ __ ] mortified and he's like so he's
like, "What the [ __ ] just happened?" And
again,
>> God,
>> no one from Twitch there. I I say to
this guy, I'm like, "I'm sorry you had
to see that." And he's like, "No, like
I'm so sorry that happened to you. Why
am I having to tell the TwitchCon
attendees and my fans, sorry you had to
see that, and not like
>> the Twitch,
>> someone from Twitch or Twitch security.
>> Anyway, um,
>> very interesting.
>> So, I didn't see this. This is just what
my friend and my manager were telling
me. Um,
the Twitch security like kind of like
got together after that and we were
like, "Wait, what happened? Oh, I didn't
even see what happened. Haha." uh and
just like started talking about
something else.
>> I guess they must also be the moderation
team.
>> And then
that's the the events of what happened
just to like
>> line all that up.
>> But I didn't talk at all about the
aftermath of all of this at all. And I
don't think anyone knows this save for
like maybe some streamers that I'm
friends with that came to spend time
with me or that I talked to last night.
Okay. Um,
>> here we go.
>> I So, I finished the meet and greet and
I was escorted back to my hotel by my
one security guard. Oh, and also, by the
way, I uh I've seen clips people
bringing up clips of me talking about
how my previous favorite security guard
was permab from TwitchCon.
>> Yeah. because um at a previous TwitchCon
two years ago, I believe I think it was
two years ago, uh there was a stalker
and he held him by the arm until police
got there and because of that he was
indefinitely banned from TwitchCon, like
from all of TwitchCon, not just the
venue, because that was in Las Vegas,
>> of course.
>> Anyway, that just just a side note,
>> naturally.
>> Okay. Um
man, I wrote down a lot of
>> Totally makes a lot of sense.
C can I just also say what you guys are
seeing here is character development.
I've always been the person who never
says [ __ ] Like I just want everyone to
have fun for things to go well.
Why am I the person who has to do this?
So, I'm Anyway, after I'm escorted back
to my hotel,
um I let some of my friends know they
come to my hotel to see me and spend
time with me, like make sure I'm okay
and everything. Um and then my manager's
letting me know. She says, "Okay, I I've
she my manager,
>> I've contacted the police. They're going
to come talk to you about pressing
charges, etc. They're trying to find the
guy. They haven't found him.
which means they let him go.
>> I'm like, "What?"
>> Yeah.
>> He Anyway
Anyway, um
so at at some point while I'm with my
friends, a police officer comes and
talks to me, interviews me, interviews
my manager, talks to my uh Twitch
partner manager, who by the way, she's
so sweet. Like she she didn't do
anything wrong here. Um
all of that happens and then I'm
complaining to my friends. I'm like,
"The [ __ ] do I do here, guys? Like, I
have to I have to talk about this blah
blah blah." And they're like, "Oh, like,
don't worry about that right now." And
then suddenly wakes like, "Wait, why is
my Discord saying hope Emy's okay?" And
I'm like, "Oh, fuck." I guess the clip
got posted again. Thank god someone was
filming because otherwise I don't think
Twitch would have sent me a thing. Um,
so after that, I start getting
>> a lot of messages. I'm responding to
people and my manager comes back to me
and she's upset. She's like, "Okay, uh,
I've been talking to Twitch people and
I'm really upset because
>> please say it.
>> I noticed a lot of negligence around the
event and I'm not happy with the way
that they're handling it now."
>> Yeah.
>> And I'm like, "What do you mean?" She's
like, "Well, um, I asked them, you know,
like what are they going to do about
this?" And you know what they said
initially? Please, please say it.
>> They said, "Oh, well, he's banned from
the platform for 30 days."
>> Yes. Yes. For 30 days. They were banning
him for 30 days.
>> What?
>> He got a month suspension.
>> Obviously, like, hello.
>> Yes.
>> Like, that needs to be indeed. What the
[ __ ] are you talking about? Also, that's
like nothing to do with anything. No one
gives a [ __ ] if he's banned on Twitch.
Talking about the convention here. So
they they
>> I won't say who did it,
>> but I know takes an hour for that to
happen, by the way. Uh these two people
are um
>> the head of security for Amazon and the
head of risk for Twitch.
>> Wow.
>> Yep. That was who
>> I was going to leak it to my friend, but
I guess I don't have to now.
>> So later the same night, I'm not going
to drop names here because I wasn't
there. So I didn't
>> That's who they were. But I had multiple
people tell me that key representatives
last night were out partying.
>> She's speaking about Dan Clancy himself,
by the way.
>> Uh
>> was out partying at an influencer event
while this was happening.
>> Sorry, my my lines are all crazy here.
Um
>> I'll say that one.
>> Um my Twitch Twitch didn't approach my
manager to talk to their head of
security. It took them two hours to
approach her to talk about what happened
and by then she had already talked to
police and called a lawyer on her own.
My manager Melissa.
>> Yeah.
>> And uh they showed her a photo of the
guy that I believe a fan took. 30 days a
fan took a photo of him. 30 days.
>> They're like, "Oh yeah, here's this
photo. Uh we're like going to find him."
He still had his badge and his wristband
and everything. The guy
So, um, yeah, I I really feel like a lot
of this process wouldn't have happened
if it weren't for my manager advocating
for me so hard.
>> The people that did that should be
fired, by the way.
>> Instantly fired.
>> Um, here, I'll get to that later. I I'll
keep going here.
So they they also showed my manager um
some security footage of the area and
the guy was able he was waiting for
there to be a gap in security and there
was he was able to walk through the side
not through like the two lanes of uh
meet and greet people who had signed up
and been like background checked for my
meet and greet. He was able to just walk
through because there just wasn't like
consistent security there.
Oh my gosh. And then um so yeah, that's
basically
>> that's what it was
>> my day yesterday.
And then today um this morning
I was told that um Amazon flew in their
global head of something to redesign the
whole process and security of the con
for the rest of the convention.
Why wasn't there someone like that here
already?
>> Because they didn't care. Did
>> they do that beforehand? Like, hello.
I'm sorry.
>> That's why they gave Senna those guards.
>> Yeah, they I guess they know that they
[ __ ] up really bad.
>> They did.
>> If they're flying in their global
Amazon's global head
and also I I want to make it clear so
that people understand this. I am so
lucky and privileged. Okay, do you know
how much I spent on security to be able
to come to this event in the first
place? Like, but I I'm not just talking
about yesterday. I'm talking about my
security for like my RV trip that I did
with my friends and stuff. I spent over
$10,000.
>> That was a lot.
>> Some people who stream on Twitch don't
even make $10,000 in a year.
>> What the [ __ ] is supposed to do? Like if
you watch
>> you have to play for plane tickets for
them.
>> The one who pushes the guy away is my
security. The woman who pulls me to the
back. My manager.
>> Yeah.
>> If you're a small streamer and you don't
have those resources or someone in your
line's not filming,
>> what the [ __ ] do you do?
>> No one would have known.
>> Like it it's it's actually [ __ ]
insane.
Like I like I I'm genuinely angry. Like
I
am not an angry person. Like it it's
just ridiculous. And like honestly I I
genuinely think there have been other
people who have been
>> she's right.
>> Sexually assaulted, groped.
>> She's right.
>> Who [ __ ] knows worse.
>> She's right
>> at these conventions. And just nobody
knows
>> because like I said, they didn't post
any kind of announcement. weren't
letting other streamers with similar
events as me, similar meet and greets
know until there was like a viral clip.
And by the way, they they can't even
mention my name in it.
>> They're doing that to avoid SEO in order
to avoid linking the company with her
name and the controversy.
>> Hold on. Let me
>> That's the reason why it's intentional
because
>> it's the same reason why they didn't
apologize.
>> That was crazy to wake up to. Um,
>> it's just damage control, optics. Uh,
they don't give a [ __ ] about her. They
still don't. Even with this happening,
they still don't care.
>> Twitchcon is our highest priority. The
behavior displayed by the individual
involved in the incident yesterday with
involving a high-profile streamer was
completely unacceptable and deeply
unsettling. In line with existing
TwitchCon security protocols, law
enforcement event security were on site.
>> That's a lie.
>> That's not true.
>> That's literally a lie. And responded to
the incident. We immediately blocked
this individual from returning to the
TwitchCon premises and they're banned
indefinitely from Twitch both online and
in person events
>> after after her manager put pressure on
them after the 30-day thing.
>> We are courting with the impacted
creators team that that's true and per
our standard protocols continue to
cooperate with any law enforcement
investigations. We've increased security
at the meet and greet attendee check-in
point and we'll have additional security
personnel surrounding participating
streamers.
>> A 30-day ban. you've RSVPd for a meet
and greet. Please note that we're unable
to accommodate plus ones for the
remainder of the event. You know why
they said that? They only they only
thought about that because of Melissa,
my manager. She said, "Were you vetting
people coming through the line?" They
said, "Oh, yeah. Everyone had to sign up
and uh they get background checks, but
uh they're allowed to bring a plus one."
Well, are there plus ones background
checked? No.
Melissa was like, "Okay, guys. Um,
>> they're so stupid tolerance for
harassment or accident inhibit the
safety and security of our community."
>> It is crazy, isn't it?
>> Um,
yeah.
>> Isn't it amazing?
>> Yeah. I I don't even know. Like, I'm I'm
just tired, guys. Like, I'm just so
tired of
I I've just had so many things happen.
And like you know, stuff just happens
like
>> especially when you're like a creator or
like a girl creator in particular. Yep.
>> But I just feel like I've been failed so
many times or lied to so many times.
>> She has been.
>> I'm always like, you know, it's okay.
We'll figure it out.
>> You should have figured it out already.
>> You should have [ __ ] figured it out
already.
Oh my god.
So yeah. Um, that's basically, unless
I'm forgetting something, a rundown of
everything. Um,
but yeah, it's just it's [ __ ] insane.
And I mean,
I'm not usually the type of person to
talk about this stuff, but it's like,
well, did I lie about anything? No. Like
what are you gonna you going to be mad
at me for telling like the things that
y'all did wrong?
>> Too bad.
>> And like Okay, so another thought that I
had was like maybe maybe like the reason
Twitch said in their thing like oh
security immediately got the guy
>> they're lying because they're
disgusting.
>> Like shitty security and they like lied
to them so they wouldn't like you know
lose their job or not get paid.
>> Yeah, they're just they're disgusting
liars. you guys had like, you know,
actual cameras in like good comms, no
one would be able to lie or have to lie.
Like, why why is it better to or like
easier to find out something happened in
[ __ ] Among Us than at TwitchCon?
>> Because they don't care.
>> That's why it's [ __ ] insane.
But yeah, um I just want to tell you
guys all that
uh this is character development. I'm
I'm [ __ ] sick of it. I'm so sick of
it. Like this this was just the final
straw for me.
Oh my goodness.
Oh,
>> is she contemplating discussing the
other straws? I wonder.
>> Yeah. Um
I have been
Okay. Some something else. Sorry. I just
I just keep remembering [ __ ] It's going
to be like this for the rest of the
stream. Uh
I saw a thing that said I was in their
like top five or top five or top 10 most
followed streamers attending this event.
Again, if that happened to me, what the
[ __ ] is happening to small creators that
we don't even hear about because no
one's filming them? like they tweet it
and like Twitch doesn't feel the need to
follow up with them or publicly
>> like like NMP and wake.
>> They don't care. They only care about
optics.
>> Yeah, I think I covered everything and
I've uh been a streamer on Twitch for 10
years. I attended the very first or
maybe the second TwitchCon ever
>> in a 2016 2015.
>> How was it more normal then? And um
yeah, like I I understand back then it
was different, but I I feel like
there like I know they say there's
security upgrades, but it really feels
like there's not.
>> They're lying.
>> Another thing that
>> they're obviously lying.
>> I forgot to mention.
>> So, the way that the meet and greet
worked is like people light up, they
come through, they take a picture, then
they're supposed to walk through the
back and leave.
>> There were people walking through the
back trying to come up to my booth.
>> Yeah, of course. or like I mean not all
of them were like malicious intent
obviously like some people would leave
oh [ __ ] my picture was bad I'm gonna go
back and ask for another one and my
manager had to be the one to tell them
like oh no you can't like keep moving
>> and there was even like I think it was
[ __ ] neon was able to walk through
the back through the back of my meet and
greet and was like oh hey like can I
come say hi and it's like what the [ __ ]
like oh my god it it was just horrible
like there was no thought put into
>> um
>> and yeah, I was like, man, it's just
[ __ ] it's just [ __ ] naked and
afraid out here. Like, thank God I have
my manager and my security and my
friends, but like I just feel so bad
for, you know, Twitch creators who
wouldn't be able to be in that position.
Are you okay, though? Um,
this is going to sound [ __ ] up.
Honestly, I'm so desensitized to stuff
like that that when it happens, I kind
of just go into like lock in mode. I'm
like, "Okay, I need to just lock in and
like get through this."
>> She does the same thing I do.
>> Worry about it later.
>> That's how I was able to
>> She deals with it in immediate in
immediiacy and then she crashes out
later.
>> Crying. You're built different for going
back out there. And like I said, I was
going back out there and having to
apologize to people in my own mind
>> being like, "I'm sorry you saw that. I
hope you're okay." And then they of
course were like, "What the [ __ ] Why
why are you saying that to me?" But I
felt like I had to because no one else
was there.
And uh like I said on Twitter, um
like I really wish I didn't have this
opinion. Like I love trying to be like
the positive like, "Oh, let's get
together and have fun everyone." Uh,
I really like would discourage other
creators from going back to TwitchCon,
not just because,
>> thank God,
>> because it was able to happen at all
>> and true
>> what happened during it and the
aftermath.
>> The whole thing,
>> everything about it was bad.
>> The entire thing,
>> it's it's just crazy. Like
why why why would their PR team say that
they don't care? You see in the clip
that walk away
>> because they they don't care about you.
>> They don't care about their creators.
>> Thank you guys. Um
>> that's the reason why it's the obvious
answer.
>> Appreciate all the support and stuff.
>> They're mismanaged and they're full of
retards.
>> Getting all the messages and stuff last
night. And again, I've said it like five
[ __ ] times. Thank [ __ ] god that
someone was filming and decided to post
it because if not, you know what I would
be doing today?
>> I would be so [ __ ] stressed being
like, "Okay,
>> I wonder if it's going to gonna happen."
>> I have to disrupt my stuff that I have
planned to announce that this thing
happened to me and let people know that
it could happen to them.
So, thank [ __ ] God for that guy.
Like, thank you so much for doing that.
Um,
and
I would just encourage everyone just to
stand the [ __ ] up.
Stand up for yourself. Stand up for
other people. Cuz if you don't,
look what [ __ ] happens. Which is
crazy because I saw Valkyrie, I saw
Pokey, I saw Hassan, I saw Cutie saying,
"I don't really want to go to TwitchCon
because I don't feel safe." And everyone
was saying that they were stupid or
overreacting
people.
>> That's why I defended them were saying
that
>> and Twitch's response to that was to be
like, "Oh, don't worry everyone else.
Uh, we up security."
>> Yep.
>> I should have listened to them.
>> Yep.
>> Especially because I mean, a lot of
people know stuff like this has happened
to me in the past and I just keep going.
Like I'm I'm the kind of person that's
like, you know what? I'm not going to
let a shitty person or a shitty thing
ruin my life or like what's going on for
me. You know what I mean? [ __ ] it. We
ball.
So, I was like, I'm going to go anyway.
I'm just going to be smart. I'm going to
pay for security. I'm only going to do
my show. How is someone going to attack
me at my show?
>> Yeah.
>> I'm only going to do my meet and greet.
How the [ __ ] would they get into a meet
and greet? It's It's roped off with
security.
Nope.
Nope. Lesson learned. Um,
and also after it happened, uh, Twitch
did offer if I wanted some of their
Twitch security. I was like,
>> I've had enough of your security, bro.
>> I was lucky enough that, um, Clemens,
who's one of my usual security guards,
>> flew out from Austin, Texas this morning
to be there with me today.
>> Yeah.
>> Have to go to likes like that.
>> Please don't give Please don't give me
any more Twitch security, Amazon. But I
have my personal security guard I feel
comfortable with is like my main guy.
Um, and they said that they like change
security for the show and stuff. But
yeah, I'm I'm just done. Like this is
the kind of thing that it's like once
you break the trust for something like
this, you're you're never getting it
back.
>> Yeah.
>> I'm sorry.
>> If they had handled it well with her and
not lied about it.
>> First time that something like this has
happened. It's like the trust was
already kind of broken and that caused a
lot of people not want to come. Like for
example, people were talking about how
last year uh Nick and Nol and Wake
Wilder
got assaulted. A guy literally walked up
to Nick on stream and licked his nipple,
which again, if that wasn't filmed on
stream, would anything have been done? I
don't
>> It was filmed on stream and nothing was
done.
>> Like an official announcement about it.
They didn't reach out to Nick as far as
I know. He was saying that last year. So
I if if they did reach out to him, it
was way after the con. Um, so it's like,
>> yeah, they didn't give a [ __ ]
>> They just not think it was a big deal.
Is it because Nick's a guy?
>> That's it. Both.
>> Like,
hello.
>> Both.
>> I'm supposed to be working on my run of
show right now. Um, I am still doing the
show, like I said, because of uh the
production staff worked really hard on
it.
>> A lot of people
>> and the cosplayers involved worked
really hard on it. So, I I still want to
do it, but this is going to be my last
TwitchCon show. I'm doing it with Baby
No Money and Will Meth. So,
even though we haven't really had time
to go over this in practice, uh it'll be
fine. It'll be a [ __ ] show, but it'll be
fine. I'm sure it'll be fun. Um
>> lots of talented people working in
Twitch production and uh
all that. It's uh
Yeah.
Anyway, um, how we feeling, you guys?
Yeah, I'm flying home tomorrow and my
security guard's going to be
accompanying me to fly home. But it it's
just sad the world that we live in now.
Like to me, I I don't even think of
myself as like
someone
that needs to be protected or like
someone important, but it's like
>> just weird.
>> Just a bunch of [ __ ] weirdos, man.
>> You know, I was talking about how like
>> so many [ __ ] weirdos buy a new
hamster recently.
>> I was thinking about how if I if I want
to do that on stream, I have security to
go buy a [ __ ] hamster.
>> Yeah. And like I said, I spent over
$10,000 alone just to come to TwitchCon
for security. I probably spent close to
six figures total going to cons and uh
stuff on security. And again, it's not
like this only happens to people of my
size. This happens to to girls.
>> Any girl that
>> has 50 viewers.
>> Yeah.
>> What the [ __ ] are they supposed to do?
Any girl that has an audience this
happens to.
>> It's like you got to just deal with it.
Not or you're
>> That's another thing. I could have
[ __ ] died yesterday.
>> That would have been bad.
>> That would have sucked.
>> But yeah, um obviously
>> I'm going to be making my own personal
changes going forward. I already have
like
>> for years. But I'm just really hurt and
disappointed by how everything was set
up by Twitch and like how it was handled
after. Um
>> I wonder who the people were that made
that decision.
>> Like honestly that ups was upsetting. I
wonder why they made that decision.
>> More angry last night than everything
else. Like it's like okay
you know any any person can be walking
on the street and get assaulted. Like
yeah it's it's [ __ ] horrible. It's
[ __ ] horrible. But why do I have to
worry about that happening at the
convention for the place that I work?
>> Because they don't care about you.
>> I don't know. I'm just talking in
circles now.
>> That's the reason why they don't care.
>> I don't know, guys. Um,
y'all seem like fit for the show.
You want revenue from the ticket sales?
Yeah, that's exactly it.
>> Bonnie, help me put all money. Yeah.
>> And I've got the heels. Shows in [ __ ]
28 minutes. Um
>> Oh, boy.
>> [ __ ] me.
Uh I'm sure it'll be fine. I'm just I'm
just going to try to have fun. Uh try to
like, you know, let the cosplayers and
people that came to participate in it
shine.
And then I'm going home.
>> That's it. Yep.
>> Yes, sir.
>> Yes, sir. Um
trying to remember if I forgot to touch
anything else.
I think that's pretty much it. Um
yeah, this stream [ __ ] sucked. I feel
like I'm being forced to do a press
conference because it's like if I don't
say these things, no one is going to.
And then they're just gonna act like it
never happened next year.
>> Great. Uh,
>> just like they did last year.
>> Remember when I was just a girl in
Kansas playing League in my room and the
worst thing that ever happened to me was
someone said I was like a boosted [ __ ]
in chat or something?
>> That was me.
>> Wish I could go back to that.
>> That was my alt account.
Um,
what else? Uh, shout out to my friends.
>> Yeah,
>> all the people that reached out to me.
Um,
I remember Lucari in particular was
like, "Yo, Emmy, you need another
security guard? I I can be there. I'll
I'll make sure that I'll I'll keep you
safe."
>> Not taking Teard.
I was like, "Ah,
>> thanks, bro.
Um.
>> Mhm.
>> Yeah, my brain is
>> Lucari is definitely that guy. I
immediately believe that. Um,
but yeah, this um
this was kind of like I guess you could
say like a climax for me in my character
development cuz this year already um
I know there's a lot of people that
watch me that are kind of similar to me
in some regards in terms of being like a
more like timid or like glass half full
type of person or like wanting to
believe the best in people type of
person.
>> Big mistake.
Um, I still believe that you can be that
way and I still believe that I'm still
that way.
>> But I've definitely
come to realize
>> there's some roaches. I really want
everyone to really think about there's a
lot of roaches out there.
>> You have to stand the [ __ ] up for
yourself, for other people because it
people who are just going to take the
easy lazy route because it doesn't
affect them so they don't care. like a
lot of the people that were hired to
work on this event.
>> Yeah. Like
>> I obviously I don't
>> because they're lazy.
>> So many horrible things. I don't want
things like this to happen to other
people or at least for it to not be that
easy for it to happen to other people. I
do feel like it's partially my
responsibility. Um
I mean not to like make sure things
don't happen, but to let people know
that these kinds of things happen
because they should know. And again,
it's crazy that nothing was said about
this publicly or to other creators who
had similar events as me until there was
a viral clip.
>> I can't believe they didn't give Emily
extra security. Isn't that nuts? Like
extra Emily.
>> Can you believe that?
>> Crazy weekend.
>> What the [ __ ] man?
>> Crazy [ __ ] weekend.
But yeah, I love you guys. I'm not going
to stop streaming. I'm not gonna stop,
you know, trying to interact with fans
in a in a safe way.
>> Never stop going big dick. That's right.
Streams, which is sad because I love
convention streams, but I mean, it is
what it is. You can't can't control the
weather. You know what I'm saying?
Um, but yeah, I just really hope that
nothing else happens to anyone else this
weekend.
um that we're not hearing any more
terrible stories
and um I really feel like the only way
to hold
people accountable is to show that it's
not okay
by things by for example like I was
saying creators not going to these
events because a lot of these tickets
are sold
>> because of the creators you mean like
what I was doing.
>> And I really feel like I was treated
like cattle or merchandise
>> cuz
>> I wonder why.
>> Why? Because you were.
>> Why is no one there making sure I'm safe
like a person? Why are the security
guards I said
>> joking and laughing about the county
fair?
>> See what happened?
>> Oh jeez.
Um, and yeah, I don't I don't even care
if I lose any like opportunities or
anything for talking about this because
it's it's [ __ ] insane. And another
thing I've realized is sometimes if you
don't say something, no one else is
going to.
>> Yeah.
>> Sometimes you have to be the one that,
you know, steps up and starts the
conversation.
And yeah, like I said, this isn't even
the first thing that happened because my
friends Nick and Wake, it happened to
them last year. And yeah, maybe just cuz
they're men or something, it wasn't
taken seriously, which is
>> it didn't get as much traction.
>> Yeah, stay stay safe, guys. Look out for
your friends.
Um, you know, if you're here this
weekend, uh, you know, stay in groups.
Um,
>> ape strung together.
>> I I mean, I would love to know if like
other things have happened to other
smaller creators and it's just being
drowned out because Twitch isn't giving
them the same attention that they're
giving me. I would love to know even if
it happened in the past because it's
[ __ ] ridiculous. Like maybe things
happen at How about that? How about
this? Maybe I should have people message
because of your
>> and they can come on my stream maybe
tomorrow or next day and talk about
them.
>> This should not be this kind of an
issue.
>> Maybe that's a good idea. What do What
do you guys think about that
>> talked about to this extent?
Oh my goodness.
>> Huh?
>> Yeah. I I would love to know that you
guys should post it.
>> Seems like a great idea.
>> Happened to you. Like, please do.
>> Oh, I need a minute. Sorry. Give me a
sec.
Yeah, I'm just very
>> I'm
>> not sure if I'd be able to liability
legal reasons. I'd have to think I have
to think about it.
>> It implies about
>> other people because if if I wasn't
important,
>> imagine what they are.
>> There's hundreds of thousands of people
that stream on Twitch.
>> Yeah.
>> Like
I I don't know. I just want I genuinely
again I hate being this kind of person.
I genuinely want people to be held
accountable and for things to like
visibly be changed. But even so, I
personally am not going to another
TwitchCon. I'm done.
>> 10 years of streaming. I'm done. This is
my final TwitchCon.
>> RIP Bozo. Rest in piss. You won't be
missed.
>> Thank God video games in my room.
>> I Yeah, I hope this happened to any any
other creators. you know that you are
cared about and people do want to know
and yeah. Um
yeah, that was a a lot.
>> Yeah.
>> Sorry guys. I hate uh
hate the heavy stuff.
really hate the heavy stuff.
And I know there's some some uh some
people at Twitch and Amazon watching
right now. Please, like, please just
listen. Like, people aren't saying this
for no reason. Like, I feel like you
guys don't get it or something. Like,
>> they don't get it.
>> I could have literally been stabbed
yesterday.
Literally. Like,
>> I think they get it. They just don't
care. It's too expensive for them.
>> I have also seen people asking if I'm uh
if I'm like taking any type of legal
action. Uh I am pressing charges against
the guy,
>> right?
>> Um with the police.
>> As for anything else, uh I don't know
yet because I've been having my manager
handle all of those like side
conversations.
So I I have no idea. I don't This is
It's just not okay.
just through Twitch. I I
>> But at the bare minimum, I will be
pressing charges against the guy that
was there.
>> It's complicated.
>> Duh.
>> Um,
>> they're going to have to look into it.
>> Yes, sir.
I mean, it's also kind of funny. I'm
literally doing this in TwitchCon. They
just gave me a a an empty conference
room to just [ __ ]
>> to rant about him. spell everything. But
yeah, I
>> I really feel like there's a lot of key
people that are responsible that need to
be held accountable
because clearly there's been multiple
points of failure for this to have even
happened in the first place
>> because they don't care.
>> And again, forgive me if I'm just
rambling in circles.
>> That's it.
But I I do also want to say, yeah, there
there's a lot of people that work at
Twitch that are lovely, amazing,
creative people,
>> but
>> it's not them.
>> But
>> there's definitely multiple people that
their failure allowed this to happen.
Multiple people.
>> Yeah,
>> for sure.
I I don't have any doubt about that,
especially because of the fact that they
flew out the global head of talk to my
my manager and my security guard today.
30-day suspension, guys.
A 30-day suspension for sexually
harassing one of the top streamers,
female streamers on the platform at
their event.
A 30-day ban. We're going
>> to do our show with Will and Baby Money.
>> Not so good, huh?
>> Try to have fun. Uh during it, uh I know
a lot of you guys are still mad, but I'd
prefer if we could just not talk about
it. just like focus on the show and like
the people in the show, not just be
spamming like [ __ ] Twitch or whatever,
you know,
>> can do that after.
>> Yeah. Um cuz like I said, there's a lot
of people that worked on the show that
had absolutely nothing to do with what
happened yesterday. I would like to for
them to still, you know, be able to have
a good show and, you know, feel like
people enjoyed it. Um, and that it was
fun because I I didn't do a lot of work
on the show. Like, I came up with a lot
of the concept,
but uh I only did probably like one to
two% of the actual setup and production.
So,
yeah, I I don't want to be unfair to
those people.
Um,
yeah, I have to head over there in like
five minutes.
I do have one more thing to say, but
just give me a sec.
Guys, no one's going to be mad at me if
I go home and play League of Legends at
this point, right? Like, I [ __ ]
deserve it, okay?
He said, "I have a weird mouth tick when
I'm stressed
and I feel it.
All right, guys. Minutes to Showtime.
Don't do it, Asthma.
>> Yeah, I don't know.
>> It's okay.
>> Like I said, I'm okay. I'm fine because
>> What do you think? This is a TwitchCon
meet and greet.
>> Try to like sound tough or something.
I'm genuinely just built built
different. Like I'm used to this [ __ ]
Um I can handle it. I can like go live
and do [ __ ] after. But there's so many
people that like I I would never want
this to happen to someone else.
Most people would have just cancelled
their show and went home probably. And I
don't think anyone would [ __ ] blame
them.
Yeah, I just I worry a lot for um small
creators,
not not even small creators, even
medium-sized creators who can't afford
one, two, three security guards
coming to [ __ ] like this. I I don't
know. Just be safe out there, guys. Try
to be smart. Um stick with your friends
and your group.
And uh
yeah, don't be afraid to talk or ask for
help
if you ever need stuff. And then as a
community, we need to stand up for each
other and look out for each other and
talk about things when things happen to
each other.
>> Yep.
And uh the last thing that I want to say
is um I didn't really get a chance to
talk about it because of you know all
the things that were happening but
um I kind of wanted to apologize for
uh some people were talking about the
clip of me
>> here we go
>> getting kind of emotional at the end of
the RV trip. um
that [ __ ] kind of just slipped out. But
there's a lot of things that
I haven't wanted to talk about
that I think I will probably be talking
about
uh when I get home from TwitchCon.
So, just want to let you guys know about
that.
Uh
yeah, thank you guys for the support.
And uh I should probably head over to
the getting ready area for the show
because I think that the other people
>> I didn't think she was going to say
>> the show already. They're getting
dressed. So I'm gonna go talk to them.
So, uh, Ally, if you could put on a BRB
and then soon there should be like a a
show starting soon thing. It'll be like
10 minutes or so and then, um, showtime.
But yeah, thank you guys. Uh, thanks for
letting me rant about all this.
Uh, yep.
Love you guys.
And uh yeah, look out for each other.
I'll see you all in 10 minutes.
I'm gonna end this here and then we're
going to go to our BRB.
So hopefully some of you guys will watch
the show.
Bye.
If you think this is crazy, just wait
for the next one.
