Most people think that aging means
losing strength, getting stiff joints,
and eventually giving up your
independence. But that's a lie. It
doesn't have to be this way. In this
video, I'm going to show you five
movements backed by science that can
literally reverse aging. We've taught
these to thousands of students, men and
women, ranging from people in their 30s
all the way to 70s, athletes to
beginners, and they all walk away moving
better than people half their age. Look,
your body isn't broken because of your
age. It is broken because of inactivity.
Muscles shrink when you don't challenge
them. Joints lock when you stop using
their full range. Balance fades when you
don't train it. But the body is
adaptable at any age. I've seen it
happen thousands of times with our
students. And now I'm going to show you
five movements that you can start today
to reclaim strength, freedom, and
resilience. Number one, hanging. Rebuild
the shoulders and rewire the grip.
Hanging decompresses your spine,
rebuilds your shoulders, and trains grip
strength. And grip strength is not just
about opening jars. Researchers
literally use it as a biioarker of
longevity. If you're a beginner, use a
chair to support some of your weight.
Let your shoulders gently open and build
up accumulated time in the hang
position. You can start with 5 to 10
second increments. If you're
intermediate, then do a full dead hang.
20 to 40 seconds. Keep the ribs down,
neck long. Aim to increase time in the
hang and build up to 5 minutes daily.
And advanced, build up to 10 minutes
daily across variations. Mixed grips,
scapular pulls, even one arm hangs. A
lot of people tell me they don't have
anywhere to hang. Apparently, they don't
have trees. They don't have anywhere to
put their rings over. So, what you can
do is you can find yourself a rail. You
can literally grab onto the rail like
this, place your feet up onto it, and
get into this position. You will
literally get very similar benefits as
you would to hanging. And the more that
you kind of allow your lower back to
sink down, the more you'll be able to
stretch out through that spine and the
shoulders. So, this is a really nice
hack if you don't have anywhere to hang.
A 2018 BMJ study showed low grip
strength is one of the strongest
predictors of early death linked to
heart disease, cancer, and all cause
mortality. One of our students, Chris,
who's 61 years old, started with a
2-cond assisted hang. Within weeks, she
was at 30 seconds unassisted. She told
us she hadn't felt her shoulders this
free in decades, and it even inspired
her to start hula hooping again. The
takeaway: Hang daily. You will
decompress your spine, strengthen your
shoulders, and literally grip more life.
Number two, the deep squat. Owning the
human resting position. The deep squat
isn't a gym exercise. It's the original
human resting position. Lose it and you
lose ankle mobility, hip function,
spinal health, and eventually your
independence. If you're a beginner, hold
a door frame or a couch. Elevate your
heels on books. Accumulate 2 to 5
minutes daily. If you're a complete
beginner and you find it very difficult
to squat like this, you can use
something to assist yourself. So, you
teach your body to come down in that
position, you use it for support and
that will allow you to sit back and be
able to get down deeper. If you're still
struggling, what you can do is elevate
your heels. So, if you have a step, prop
your heels up, squat down. This will
make your position much, much easier to
do. So you have those two options to
work with if you can't get down as the
grass. Intermediate people squat
unassisted chest tall. Get comfortable
in that position. Aim for 15 to 20
minutes daily. And if you're advanced
then explore different stances. Spend 30
plus minutes across the day. The goal
the squat becomes your natural resting
position. The sitting rising test 2012
European Journal of Preventative
Cardiology showed people who struggled
to sit and rise from the floor were five
times more likely to die within 6 years.
One of our students, Pamela, had her
first breakthrough in the squat after
years of stiffness. She messaged us that
she sat fully down for the first time in
decades. Another student, Tom, went from
a shaky 30 secondond to holding a deep
squat for 7 minutes. Takeaway: Your
squat is not optional. It's survival
training. Reclaim it and you reclaim
your youth. Number three, sit to stand.
The independence test. The ability to
get down to the floor and back up again
is the line between dependence and
independence. Lose it and you lose your
freedom. If you're a beginner, sit on a
chair, stand up without using your
hands. Aim to lower the chair over time.
If you're intermediate, lower to a low
stool or the floor. Rise using only your
legs. Lower to the ground with no hands
and get up with the hands supporting.
Sitting down and standing up can
literally be as simple as squatting down
to a box and standing up with no hands.
When you get better, you can practice
squatting down on one leg and coming up
on two. Over time, you can practice your
cross-legged sits. And then eventually
as you improve your mobility, you can do
various sits, kneeling positions,
transitions along the floor, and
teaching yourself to actually sit down
and stand up with control. The same
sitting rising test showed that every
point you lose on the test equals a 21%
higher risk of death. Patricia, one of
our students in her 60s, told us that
her dream was simple. I just want to
stand up without using my hands. After 3
months, she did it. Another student,
Catherine, filmed herself standing from
the floor for the first time in years.
The joy on her face said it all.
Takeaway: If you can stand from the
floor without help, you are literally
lowering your risk of early death. Train
this daily. Number four, hip mobility.
The foolproof foundation. Hip mobility
isn't about stretching your hip flexor
or doing yoga. It's about survival.
Stiff hips equals poor balance and
higher fall risks. and falls are the
number one way that aging robs people of
their independence. Beginners should aim
to improve their 9090 hip rotations,
gentle rocks on the floor, using hands
to assist and slowly increasing the
dosage of difficult positioning.
Intermediate people start exploring
assigned Kak squats, pigeon poses, and
low gate flows, all with intention of
increasing load and reducing assistance.
And if you're advanced, full locomotion
patterns, moving across the floor like a
cat, crawling, stepping, flowing, all
with ease and freedom. Hip mobility
starts with basic things like teaching
your body internal rotation, external
rotation, and then combining those two
patterns. You can also work your way
towards doing things like advanced
pigeon poses. You can work your way
towards 9090 stretches. And over time,
just experience that real freedom that
comes with the ability to open your
hips. 2014 studies showed that hip
fractures in older adults carry a 20 to
30% chance of death within a year. One
of our students, Michelle, couldn't even
bend down to feed her dogs without pain.
After training her hips, she laughed,
sending us a video of her bending
forward easily for the first time in
years. Another student, Sharon, went
from hip pain so bad she couldn't sleep
to waking up painfree. Takeaway: Strong,
mobile hips are your life insurance.
They make you foolproof. And number
five, isometrics and core stability, the
anti-fall armor. Strength that holds you
still is as important as strength that
moves you. Isometrics such as planks,
war seats, holds train stability,
balance, and resilience. your shield
against falls. For beginners, start with
wall sits, planks, supported balances.
If you're intermediate, do longer
planks, isometric squats, single leg
balance. Start to work towards chest to
wall handstands. And if you're advanced,
do loaded carries, gymnastics holds,
static strength work, more handstands,
and straight arm strength work. You can
also throw in middle and front split
holds to strengthen your lower body.
Your isometric strength can start with
the most basic things like figuring out
your plank, then learning to switch that
over to a one- arm plank. You can play
around with side planks. Eventually, you
would take that isometric over to the
wall and practice your chest to wall
handstands.
And for the lower body, you would start
with horse stance, work your way up
towards your middle split holds, and
then switch over to the long lunge hold.
All of these will strengthen your hips,
your ankles, and your knees. The Lancet
Public Health 2018 reported that falls
are the second leading cause of
accidental death worldwide in older
adults. Gail, one of our students in her
50s, said that after 3 months of adding
stability training, she feels stronger,
moves better, and feels like herself
again. Movement really is medicine.
Ingred, another student, went from hip
pain and balance struggles to full
pain-free squats. The takeaway,
stability equals survival. Train it
daily. These five aren't fitness hacks.
They are human non-negotiables.
Hang to grit more life. Squat to stay
human. Sit to stand to stay independent.
Free your hips to avoid disaster. Build
stability to bulletproof your future.
We've seen it with thousands of our
students. From Chris rediscovering play
to Patricia regaining independence to
Sharon sleeping painfree. Movement
doesn't just slow aging, it reverses it.
