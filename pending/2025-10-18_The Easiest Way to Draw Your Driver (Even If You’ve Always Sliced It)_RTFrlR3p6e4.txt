Every golfer is going about this the
wrong way. We're thinking about the
driver and the irions as two different
swings. Just gone through this concept
with Stan. And the word I'd use is
liberating. Have you ever thought about
it like that before?
>> I hadn't. I really hadn't.
>> If this is as successful as it was with
your irions, we're talking two shots,
baby draws.
>> Oh,
>> that's the one. Look at that.
>> Did you just see that? In three shots,
you've hit a baby draw. I got to show
you your hand after that one.
>> Spot on.
>> Look at these numbers, though. We can
now put his iron swing on his driver.
>> Definitely longer. Definitely a little
draw on it. So happy with that. Look
>> at the smile on his face. And this is
what's going to happen in this video.
And on that point, this video is powered
by you, the viewers. We're answering
this question today. But if you want
your question answered, be sure to
subscribe and turn on the bell. It's the
same swing, just one thing changes, your
ball position.
>> Okay.
>> I also think you got to look at this and
go, look how good you hit it with the
drill that we're going to show people
today with your irions.
>> You hit draws pretty much straight away.
One, two shots.
>> Mhm.
>> Okay. Let's just illustrate what we're
talking about here. This yellow line is
our target line,
>> right?
>> You started with your circle. This
represents the arc of our swing
traveling massively to the left. The
drill we did nudged you to be like this.
And actually, it probably felt quite
exaggerated. Yes. Like this. And the
drill's brilliant. I knew I could see
your cogs going in your head going,
"Well, how do I take this into my
driver?" Well, this is how. So, let me
set this up. We've got our driver. We've
got a five iron, a seven iron, and a
wedge. Let me just show you this here.
And this is why every club is the same.
So, our driver ball position, where
would we have it?
>> Club length inside our
>> Okay, perfect. So, I'll rest that down
on there. And then if I grab our seven
iron, not five iron. Ignore me. Our
seven iron is where? Just let's say
ahead of center.
>> Center. Yeah.
>> Right. I'll rest that one there. Our
nine iron is similar. And our wedge is
just behind. Yeah. Okay. So if I rest
all these on my left thigh, can you see
how gradually with the same swing,
you're going to have more shaft with our
shorter clubs, i.e. our sand wedge, and
less shaffle with our driver,
>> right?
>> From all the same swing.
>> Equally, as our ball moves forward in
our stance, we're going to hit less
down. And then as our ball moves back,
we're going to hit more down on the
ball.
>> So essentially, the golf swing is the
same. the ball position just changes. So
if I bring this hoop up here and there's
a representation of that, can you see
how I would be hitting down on these
really short clubs but then up or not as
down as I get to driver,
>> right?
>> So it's the same swing
just from a different starting point. So
really when people go, "Oh god, I can do
it with my eyes but I can't do it with
driver." I think it's because they don't
have that concept that it's the same. I
think they're trying to do two different
swings
>> and really that's quite hard, isn't it?
>> Yeah.
>> Have you ever thought about it like that
before?
>> I hadn't. I really hadn't.
>> Well, now you have.
>> Right, let's show everybody this
fantastic drill. Let's get it set up and
it's a bit of a funky one, but it has
huge bang for your buck. We did this
with the irons and we're now for the
first time going to be doing it with
driver. All you need is a water bottle.
You can hit shot after shot with this.
If this is as successful as it was with
your irions, we're talking two shots,
baby draws. So let's set this up. Is
slightly different setup though. So
address that ball for us there. Then I
want us to come one, two, three club
heads in. And then we'll go a club head
in front. And that's where we're going
to place our water ball. So really, it
feels like your shaft's in the way of it
here, doesn't it?
>> Yeah.
>> This feels very close. It's
>> And it should.
>> Nervously close. Nervously close.
>> But But what's that going to do? You're
going to get immediate feedback. If you
come this way
>> Uh-huh. You're going to smack it so you
know if you're doing it right or wrong.
>> Yeah.
>> If you get it here, what you gonna do?
>> Hit it out. Right.
>> And we're going to hit a beautiful
little draw. This is what we did with
the irons. And now we're just
essentially saying, look, the golf swing
is the same. Don't think of it any
differently. It's the same. The ball
position just changes.
We start it right.
>> Just left our face a little bit where
>> stayed open with my face.
>> Brilliant. Right.
>> Close the face.
>> Take another one for me.
>> Come on.
>> But we missed it. So, we're moving our
club in the right direction.
>> So, if you've got ideas of your swing
where you're trying to transfer your
weight, continue with them. Even with
driver, trust in the ball position
theory.
>> Nearly.
>> Maybe it'll take three with driver.
>> Take three. Yeah. Come on.
>> Oh,
>> that's the one.
Look at that.
>> Did you just see that?
That was a baby draw. In three shots,
you've hit a baby draw. I got to show
you your hand after that one.
>> Spot on.
>> Look at these numbers, though.
>> So, now you just swung 1.4 to the right.
I'll bring this to life in a second so
you can see it. And you can see what
we've changed. Your face slightly
closed, the bottom left number by 0.9
>> and you hit down on it 0.6Â°. I mean,
that is nothing.
>> That is nothing. All with that visual.
And the best thing about this is you can
just take that that visual to the
course. You can't put your water bottle
down.
So if you think what we done there, you
were traveling six, seven leopard.
>> Now look at 1.4 right. 1.4 right
relative to our yellow is about there.
Let's say
>> our bottom of the arc was just before
>> but we don't mind that and our face was
slightly closed. So if you put your club
head in there for us just to represent
that and everybody can come and have a
closer look. Relative to the yellow, we
swung to the right slightly with a face
that's slightly closed. And that's all
with that there. And yes, you're going
to hit a few where the face doesn't
match it before, but there's no wonder
if before you were swinging over here,
your face always had to point right to
hit a straight one.
>> Yeah.
>> So, first few you might just hit a
straight right. But it's about learning
from that. Okay. Right. Hit the one for
me. I like the rhythm on that, too.
Brilliant. Don't try and over hit this.
Don't try and over hit this. I think
once you realize that the golf swing is
the same, the BBS just changes. It's
quite liberating.
Just a little bit of a push. Well,
that's on the fairway all day.
>> Yeah.
>> Constant, how do you feel?
>> Great shot. I feel brilliant for that.
That's such a learner.
>> So, we've got a real similar concept
that I want you to take into your game
here, too. That really the swing is the
same. The club just changes. I'm going
to have more shaft in my shorter clubs,
less shaling my longer clubs. I'm going
to hit more down on my shorter clubs and
not as down on my longer clubs. And that
whole idea of anytime you go to the golf
course, you're actually still working on
your driver. in nine shots. You're
refining the same swing, the same
thoughts.
