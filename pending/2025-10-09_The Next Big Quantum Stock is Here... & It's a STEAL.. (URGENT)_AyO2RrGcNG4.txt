Holy smokes. We have another under
theraar stock that we are going to be
discussing for the first time together
on this channel. I actually just bought
this stock today for the first time. I
put about $16,000
into it. It's about a
$16 stock. I bought about a,000 shares.
And this to me is really a starter
position.
So in this video we're going to be going
over what the stock is. It is a quantum
stock. Now Citron Research actually came
out today and said buy this stock
handover fist versus the other quantum
names. Regetti NQ.
You get it? Okay.
I think Quantum
is likely here to stay for for a while
and this stock is trading at such a
significant discount to its peers.
It's a very compelling opportunity to
say the least. Now, Citron,
I actually like Citron. I'm actually a
fan of Citron's work. I I I started to
like Citron more back in April when I
was buying Nebus, ticker symbol MBIS.
Okay, I was buying Nebus in the 20s as
the stock just uh had gotten relisted
and you know started to get a little bit
more popular. Okay,
that was back in April of 2025. Today
the stock's $125
a share. Okay, it stocks up a lot, but
Citron was one of the first guys
to uh call Nebius
the next AI Wall Street darling in
December of 2024. They can be pretty
early to things.
Okay, my kind of people because I like
to be early to things. And what we're
going to talk about in this video is a
very early stage opportunity
in quantum that as Citron Research says
and as we'll talk about in this video
could be highly
underappreciated.

We're doing this all day, every day,
finding the next hot stock
that is under the radar that Wall Street
doesn't know about and investing in it.
Whether it was Nebius or Applied Digital
or OQ
NQ at $7, Applied Digital at three,
Nebius at 22, Nardis Semiconductor at a
dollar and some change. Resolve AI, one
that I'm still heavily invested in, over
six figures in identified that stock in
the $2.50 range. Today it's $660.
Okay,
that is what we do. We like to be early
to high quality trades or investments in
AI, energy, robotics, software, gene
editing, biofarmas.
The hot themes or quantum now in this
case, the hot themes for the next decade
or two. We are in an AI cold war with
China. There's going to be um a lot of
rapid innovations. There's going to be a
lot of investment opportunities. If you
want to come join us on this journey,
check that link out down below in the
description of this video. We are up
well over 200% in the trading community
portfolio. And I think those results are
only going to get more dramatic into the
end of this year. So, let's go ahead and
get started with the opportunity that we
are talking about. And I'm about to I'm
about to pull it up on screen.
It's actually a spa.
Yeah.
Yep.
I'm not a fan of specs.
Not a fan at all.
But every now and again there's a speck
that catches my attention.
This is most certainly one of those.
This company, the spa company is going
public or merging with one of the
leaders in quantum.
Okay.
Inflection. Inflection to go public in
spa deal valuing quantum computing firm
at 1.8 billion. It says inflection will
go public through a merger with a blank
check company led by veteran Wall Street
dealmaker Michael Klein, valuing the
quantum computing startup at 1.8 8
billion before new investment. The
company said on Monday the merger with
special purpose acquisition company
Churchill Capital Corp X is expected to
provide in inflection
with more than 540 million before cost
including a co-invest co-investment from
institutional investors such as Maverick
Capital, Counterpoint Global, and Glen
Capital. So, not only are they doing
this spack, some of them are actually
just going to invest in the company as
well. Inflection, which builds quantum
computers and precision sensors, said
proceeds would accelerate pro product
development and expand applications in
areas such as artificial intelligence,
national security, and space. The
combined company is expected to list
under the tickerfq
on a North American exchange. Inflection
CEO Matthew Canella told Reuters he
expects the deal to complete later this
year or in early 2026. The company has
roughly 185 employees. It has raised 283
million in funding so far since its
inception in 2007. For a company
like inflection here,
they've only raised $283 million in
funding since 2007.
Some companies are doing that
on a six-month basis. To me, that looks
like
very good management. I mean, if you
have a different take on that, let me
know. But
it it seems like that is a really good
management like like being able to
allocate capital effectively. Yes,
they're they're they're going to be
running a loss, right? But they've only
had to raise that much money and like
they're actually generating sales. We'll
get into that in just a moment. But 2007
was a long time ago. It's 2025.
Yeah. Uh it looks like this has uh
some really good management behind it.
Now it says quantum computing firms such
as NQ, Regetti Computing, and D-Wave
Quantum have gone public through Spaxs
Spa mergers in recent years. Uh a spa is
a shell company. I'm sure you guys
understand a spa, but a spa is a shell
company that backs their shares at $10 a
share. they have two years to go public
or to merge with a private company to
take that company public. So, spaxs are
a lot easier, faster to go public,
blah blah blah. Not as ideal,
but it's a way of going public. Now, it
says inflection systems are used by chip
designer Nvidia, the US Department of
Defense, NASA, and the UK government.
The company has about 29 million in
trailing 12-month revenue as of June
30th, and it expects about 50 million in
booked and awarded business by the end
of 2025.
This company
does business with Nvidia, US Defense
Department, NASA, and the UK government.
They're looking at 50 million in booked
and awarded business by the end of 2025.
And it's only a $1.8 8 billion valuation
versus other quantum stocks like the
ones mentioned Regetti NQ that are doing
not even as much business as that.
Citron
says here why inflection ticker symbol
CCX is outpacing Regetti and why the
market hasn't priced it in. The chart on
the bottom is all you need to know.
Number one, real revenue versus research
grants. Inflection delivers 29 million
in real hardware and sensor sales.
Regetti's 11 million comes mostly from
government R&D contracts. One executes
the other experiments. Two, diversify
quantum monetization. Inflection sells
sensors, atomic clocks, and RF systems
that fund its QPU roadmap. Quantum
survives on dilution and burn.
Inflection builds a business. Forgeti
burns one. The real Nvidia partnership.
Inflection is featured by Nvidia in CUDA
Q blogs, GTC events, and developer
demos. Regetti just name drops.
Integration versus association.
Credibility matters. Neutral atoms to
semiconductors. Inflections. Neutral
atom tech scales faster. Room temp. Full
cubit connectivity. Credible path to a
thousand logical cubits by 2030. Regetti
supercomputing approach approach hits
psych sykes limits physics limits I
think uh okay real markets real ROI
inflection sells to defense aerospace
and telecom with deployable systems
regetti still pitch demos bottom line
inflection has customers revenue and
Nvidia validation has delution and press
releases the market hasn't priced the
gap between execution and aspiration
Yeah.
And they say this is all you need to
know. So basically taking a apples for
apples between Regetti and CC
CX. Okay. Regetti is currently over $40
a share. So the market caps around $15
billion.
Citron says that if inflection had a $15
billion market cap, just like Regetti
today, the stock would be $59.30. 30
cents per share. If Regetti gets to $62,
which is a $20 billion market cap, CCCX
would be an $80 stock. Today, the stock
is $16 per share. So, simple math sake,
Citron is saying that CCCX should be a
$59 stock today. But divide that by
$1620
roughly where the stock is trading at.
Citron is saying the stock should be
over three and a half times higher than
where it is today based on a comparison
to Regetti. Now Citron says that this is
only a comparison to Regetti that CCCX
should be trading much higher than
Regetti
again on this comparable that that
inflection should have a premium
valuation to Regetti. So Regetti is
trading at this inflection should be
trading higher. Now, let's go back to
Citron's post here. They also say that
CCCX does not seem to be announced, but
Inflection just on September 27th. Um,
says here, a $17 million government
contract just awarded, former name is
Cold Quanta. This is larger than
Regetti's revenue since inception. That
price sensitivity chart will get closer
every day. So they're basically saying
that,
you know, CCCX is going to go up even as
Regetti, you know, stays the same or
whatever, right? They're they're saying
the the spread is going to uh change.
Citron Research posted a third post on
CCCX.
Um, and they actually pinned this to
their uh profile. They say the most
compelling trade in quantum buy CCCX
against any position in Regetti. Not
going to try to value quantum right now.
Are they all overvalued? The market will
determine that. But what Citron can
definitively say is that inflection is
far ahead of Regetti in the quantum race
and we expect the two stocks to trade in
parody in a rapid matter manner and then
CCCX will trade at a premium. This chart
is all you need to know. again
highlighting this chart here. So
basically, Citron in simpler terms is
saying CCCX is going to start going up a
lot to match kind of where Regetti is
at. What looks like even before the spa
merger is actually completed I have on
the uh company so far. Again, we're
going to hear more about this. I think
there's going to be more attention
around um this spec over the you know
the days and weeks to come. I do think
we're very early in this this company
and and I think the real opportunity is
once the the company despbacks and goes
public via you know the spa process and
is trading as a standalone company right
but this could be one of the easiest
opportunities right now in quantum just
comparing this company to others like
Regetti NQ Dwave so on and so forth now
I did go out and I bought 500 shares in
this portfolio. Average cost $16.31.
Current market value $8,150.
And I said in the trading group that
this is really a starting position.
Okay. Um this is something that I just
want to start. You know, spacks still
kind of make me nervous. I've had a lot
of there's been a lot of bad spaxs. The
biggest risk to this trade is that the
entire quantum market goes through like
a downturn, right? people stop liking
Quantum, something like that. That's the
biggest risk at this point. If Quantum
valuations hold where they are, the
stock is going to see substantial upside
in my opinion. Now, I also bought 500
shares in this portfolio. Um, at $1642 a
share, current market value, $8,150. I'm
actually down $67 on this position. I'm
down $2.50 on this position. So, I'm
actually down on this stock. And again,
I plan to at least hold this company uh
for a while. I think there's some very
compelling arguments for um why this
stock should be dramatically higher
again relative to where other lesser
quality competitors are at right now.
Right? So, I I think there's a really
good argument um
to invest in the company, but obviously
I'm not a financial adviser. I'm not a
financial planner. This is risky stuff.
Again, the biggest risk is that the
quantum market just falls out of bed.
People don't like quantum anymore. You
know, that's the risk.
So, let me know your thoughts on this
down below in the comments section. I
did want to share this one because I
think we're very early um
on this in general. So, hit the like
button, subscribe to the channel if you
have not done so already. Check out that
link down below in the description of
today's episode. Let me know if you are
invested in this one. Um, how are you
thinking about this one? Do you like
Quantum? Do you not? Are you staying
away from Quantum in general? Again, let
me know your thoughts. I was uh really
early to Quantum. Didn't hold it nearly
as long as I should have. I actually
bought OQ at $7. I sold it at like 10,
guys.
Yeah. Uh, fumbled NQ hard. Okay. I I I
bought the stock like late 2024. Should
have just held every share, but uh now
the stock's over a 10x from where I
originally
bought NQ. So yeah, uh we'll see what
happens. Check out the link down below
