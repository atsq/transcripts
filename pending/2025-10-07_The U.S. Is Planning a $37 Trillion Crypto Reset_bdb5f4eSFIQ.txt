At the recent economic forum, one of
Putin's closest advisers dropped a
bombshell. He said that the US is
preparing to use crypto and stable coins
to secretly devalue its entire $37
trillion debt. Now, he claims America
will put that debt into a crypto cloud
they would then use to reset the system.
So, basically leaving the rest of the
world holding the bag. Now, this is
Anton Kobyakov, right? We're talking
about he's a senior adviser to Vladimir
Putin for over a decade. This isn't some
random official. This is Putin's guy.
And you know what? He's actually right.
But it's just not in the way that you
would think. You see, Russia thinks
we're going to print digital dollars out
of thin air. But that's not actually how
this works. But the devaluation part,
the reset part, that's absolutely
happening. Now, real quick, I'm Mark
Moss. I've been tracking these monetary
resets since the last one. And what's
about to happen with stable coins and
the genius act that was just passed
through is way bigger than what Russia
even understands. So let's break down
what's really going on. You ready? Let's
go.
All right. So let's look at exactly what
Russia is saying here. Back at the
Eastern Economic Forum again, Anton
Kobyakov, and remember this is Putin's
senior economic adviser, right? For over
a decade now. He's been in the room for
every major Russian economic decision.
He's laid out this theory again. He said
the US is trying to rewrite the rules of
the gold and crypto markets. His exact
words were that America's ultimate goal
is to push the whole world into what he
called the crypto cloud. Now think about
that phrase crypto cloud. He's saying
once the world's money is digital, once
it's in stable coins, once the US moves
its 37 trillion national debt into these
digital assets and then boom, devalues
it, wipes the slate clean while everyone
else is holding the bag. But here's why
this matters. This isn't just some
conspiracy theory from our enemies,
right? He's he's been architecting
Russia's economic strategy since 2012.
So when he speaks, it's not speculation.
It's what Russia's leadership actually
believes. And like I said, like he's
kind of right about devaluation. He's
actually dead right. The US absolutely
plans to devalue the debt. Now, we've
done it before. We've done it actually
multiple times, but I think Russia just
misunderstands it a little bit, right?
They think we're going to create stable
coins out of thin air like we like we
print dollars. But that's not how stable
coins work. It it's actually way more
powerful. So, let me show you what's
really happening.
1933 Executive Order 6102,
President Roosevelt. He doesn't ask
Congress. He doesn't negotiate. He signs
one piece of paper, the executive order,
and boom, confiscates America's gold at
$2067
per ounce. And then what happens?
Overnight, he revalues it to $35 an
ounce. Now, if you do the math, that's a
69% devaluation. one signature, 69% is
gone. Think about what that means. You
had $100 in savings and now it buys you
$31 worth of stuff. But the government's
debt, they just got 69% cheaper to pay
it back. Now, it's not the only time
it's happened. It's happened many times
since then. If we fast forward to 1971,
President Richard Nixon closed the gold
window. He basically rugpulled the
entire world by removing the gold
backing of US dollars. And since then,
the dollar's lost 96% of its purchasing
power. 96%.
Again, 1985, the Plaza Accords. We had
five countries get together and agree to
again devalue the dollar by 25% in two
years. And it worked. A 25% devaluation.
It was coordinated. It was planned. It
was executed. So when Russia says we're
about to reset the system again, they're
looking back at history, right? They see
the pattern. They understand why it has
to happen. Now, about every 40 to 50
year cycles, they see this coming due.
And right now, we're due. But what
they're maybe not understanding so much
is that we don't need gold confiscation
this time, right? We don't need
international agreements. We have a new
mechanism and it's already in motion.
How do you devalue dollars when you're
not on a gold standard? Well, it's
simple, right? You just continue to
expand the money supply. If we look at
the M2 chart, uh, just from January
2020, we had $15.5
trillion. Today, we have $21.9 trillion.
That's a 40% expansion in just 4 years.
40% in four years. If we look at
everything else, gas prices up 50%, home
prices up 50%. The median home in
America costs 50% more. Hm, pretty
interesting. Property insurance up 70%.
Gold 35%, Bitcoin, it's up over $250.
See the pattern? When you create $6
trillion, new dollars out of thin air,
but you don't create any new houses, you
don't create any new oil, any new
anything, right? Then the prices start
to adjust. The dollars start chasing the
same goods and prices go up. So your
grocery bill, food's up, right? 25 to
30%. Steak, milk, eggs, it's all up 30%
plus. Now, that's not inflation. It's
devaluation. Your dollar buys you less.
And here's the key. That $37 trillion of
debt, it's still $37 trillion on paper.
But what does 37 trillion buy today
versus what it bought in 2020? It buys
40% less, right? The government just cut
the real debt burden by 40%. Without
paying back a single dollar, right?
Without without having to default,
without having to negotiate with
anybody. They just printed their way
out. But here's the problem. The world,
of course, sees this, right? It's not
that China and Russia don't understand
this. It's why China's dumping
treasuries. It's why Japan's dumping
treasuries. It's why foreign ownership
of US debt dropped from 34% to 23%. Sort
of like when Nixon had to close the gold
window. So, the US needs new buyers of
debt. Cue it in. Enter the stable coins.
Russia thinks we're going to print
stable coins like we print dollars. But
of course, that's not how this works,
right? Every USDT or every USDC,
somebody has to deposit a real dollar to
get back a stable coin, right? It's a
one one peg or one one backed. Now, the
Genius Act that was just passed this
year, it mandates every stable coin must
be backed by US treasuries or cash. No
exceptions. Okay, so wait, if we can't
print them, if every stable coin needs a
real dollar behind it, then how do we
devalue the debt, right? How does this
actually help the US government? This is
the part maybe Russia doesn't seem to
get right. They're thinking about it
just a little bit wrong. It's not about
printing. It's about what those dollars
are doing and where they're coming from.
You see, when you give Tether a dollar,
they don't just put it in a vault. They
go buy US treasuries with it. When
Circle gets a dollar, same thing. They
go buy treasuries with it. So, this
creates a perpetual demand for US debt.
Now, the more the stable coins grow, the
more the treasuries they have to go buy,
right? It's automatic. gets built into
the system. But that's just part one.
The real trick is where those dollars
are going to come from. And that's what
I want to show you. If stable coins need
real dollars, how does this help the US?
Well, it's simple. Every stable coin
issuer has to buy treasuries. That's
that's the law under the New Genius Act.
You want to issue a billion dollars in
USDT? Well, you need a billion dollars
in T bills. If you look at the numbers
right now, Tether's holding 127 billion
in US treasuries. Circle holds 55
billion. Combined, they're the 18th
largest holder of US debt globally,
bigger than Germany, bigger than South
Korea. And where it starts to get
interesting is Scott Bent, he's the
Trump's, you know, Treasury Secretary.
He projects stable coins to hit $3.7
trillion by 2030. China's been dumping
treasuries down 1 trillion to 756
billion. Japan's selling foreign
ownership dropped from 34% to 25%. But
stable coins, they have to buy it,
right? It's required. Every dollar that
goes into USDT or USDC becomes demand
for US debt. So that person in Argentina
trying to escape inflation, they buy
stable coins, USDT. That business in
Turkey avoiding the LRA, they use USDC.
They all become Treasury buyers, right?
They're funding the deficit without even
knowing it. 3.7 trillion in guaranteed
Treasury demand. That's the plan. But
here's the question. Where do all those
dollars actually come from? Now, I made
a video a few months ago where I talked
about this. Um, let's let's go ahead and
just play it. Let's check it out. We're
talking about sterilized reserves. What
we're talking about is that the Federal
Reserve has given the banks a bunch of
money, but they don't want the money to
get into the economy because it would
cause massive inflation. If you dump all
this money into the economy and people
go start spending it on vacations and
trips and cars and going out to eat and
things like that, the prices will rise.
So, what they've done is they pay the
banks to leave it there, keep it out of
circulation. That's why it's called
sterilized. All right, there it is.
Sterilized reserves. Let me break down
what that means. Now, right now, US
banks have $3.2 trillion sitting at the
Fed, right? This is excess reserves.
This is money that's been parked there
since back in quantitative easing back
in 2008 for 14 years. And it's kind of
like dead money, right? It can't be
lent, right? It's not it's not in
circulation. It just sits there earning
OER or interest on excess reserves. And
that's about 0.5%.
And here's the mechanism. The Genius Act
says that banks can use these Fed
deposits as stable coin backing. They
could take a billion in excess reserves,
back a billion in stable coins, and it's
the same money, but now it's moving. 3.2
trillion, right? That's been frozen
since 2008. But now it can start to
enter the market. Not new money, the
same money, but just moved, activated.
Now, when the 3.2 trillion starts
circulating, prices start to adjust,
right? the dollar starts to weaken. The
$37 trillion in debt, it starts to get
devalued, but not through printing,
through activation of reserves. Right?
That's maybe the part Russia seems to
misunderstand. Right? We're not creating
more money. We're unleashing what's been
trapped. Now, if we look back at the
rest of the world and what they're
doing, we can see that they understand
this. Gold just hit $3,777
an ounce in September. It's an all-time
high. Central banks are buying gold at
the fastest pace since 1967.
Four straight years, over 1,000 tons. I
mean, think about this. 2022, 1,082
tons. That was the highest since ' 67.
But then again, 2023, 1,037 tons. 2024,
1,045 tons. 2025 already sitting at 669
tons. That's just through Q3. Now, this
is on pace for another,000 ton year. And
who's buying? Well, everybody's buying,
right? Poland bought 67 tons this year.
They're the biggest buyer of 2025. The
Czech Republic, they bought gold 29
straight months. They tripled their
reserve since 2023. Turkey, 26 times
consecutive months of buying. And China,
well, they've added at least, I don't
know, 36 tons in nine straight months.
And that's just what they report, right?
The real numbers probably double or
triple that. These aren't gold bugs.
These are central banks, right? These
are the most conservative institutions
on earth and they're all doing the same
thing, dumping dollars and buying gold.
Why? Because of course they see what's
coming, right? When Poland triples their
gold reserves, they're not speculating
on price, right? When Turkey buys for 26
straight months, they're not trading
that, right? They're protecting
themselves. That the sterilized
reserves, the 3.7 trillion in stable
coins, they see all that, right? They
know the dollar is about to get devalued
and they're not going to wait around to
hold the bag. That's why gold's at
$3,700 an ounce, right? The world sees
what's happening here. Now, what about
Bitcoin? What about the strategic
Bitcoin reserves everyone's talking
about? Well, the reality is Scott Bent,
Treasury Secretary, he kind of killed
it, right? He said, quote, "No taxpayer
dollars for Bitcoin." So, the SBR bill
is it dead on arrival? Well, think about
it this way. In 2022, the Chips Act, it
passed. And the reason why is because
the US government needed semiconductors.
But did they just go buy Intel stock?
No. They gave Intel $50 billion in
subsidies and grants. And then they took
warrants. They took an equity position
in Intel. It's the same playbook here.
Look at this pattern here. Um, private
innovation happens first, like SpaceX
goes and builds the rockets, then NASA
contracts them, right? Amazon goes and
builds AWS and then the CI uses the
servers, right? We have the private
sector takes the risk and then the
government is able to use or capture the
value. So the strategic Bitcoin reserve,
maybe it's not dead, maybe it's just not
happening the way you think. Maybe it
was never going to work the way that you
thought. Maybe we're already building
the Bitcoin reserves through companies
like Micro Strategy and Marathon and
Riot and through the ETFs. Maybe the
government just hasn't taken their cut
yet. All right, but let's just bring
this all full circle, right? Putin's
adviser is right. We're going to devalue
the debt, but not by printing stable
coins by activating the 3.7 trillion in
the sterilized reserves. By creating 3.7
trillion in Treasury demand by exporting
the inflation globally. And when is this
going to happen? Well, Scott Bassen said
by 2030, but I think it's going to
happen much faster. Stable coins are
growing rapidly. As a matter of fact,
they grew 32% in just 7 months. So, at
that rate, we're going to hit 3.7
trillion by 2027. And of course, the
world sees it coming. That's why gold's
at $3,700 an ounce. That's why central
banks bought 4,000 tons in four years.
That's why China is buying gold and not
US treasuries. Right? The reset's
happening. It's not an event, it's a
process. All the pieces are being put
into place right now. The Genius Act,
it's already law. The reserves are
already there. The mechanisms already in
place. Okay. So, what are you and I
going to do about this? Well, simple.
Sort of like the central banks, we don't
hold cash. We don't hold US dollars. We
don't hold US treasuries. We don't hold
fiat currency. We're holding hard
assets. We're holding gold. We're
holding Bitcoin. Of course, minerals
like lithium, right? They've all been
doing great. Real estate works, but of
course, Bitcoin. Bitcoin is my favorite
because it moves the fastest when
liquidity expands, right? It always has.
The last major reset we saw was in 1971
when the dollar was rugpulled from gold.
During that time, we saw gold go from
$35 to $800 an ounce 23 times. Bitcoin's
doing that every four years. So, plan
your positions accordingly. And if you
want to see exactly how Bitcoin
correlates to stable coin growth and
global liquidity cycles, then you
probably want to watch this video right
here. And I'll see you over there.
