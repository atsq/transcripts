Last week's crypto crash was on purpose.
Someone planned this, guys. And once you
figure that out, you'll know how to
position for what's coming next. But
guys, let's be real here. Bitcoin and
altcoins didn't just dip last week. They
got obliterated. We've just lived
through the largest liquidation event in
crypto history by a order of magnitude.
Over $19 billion in leverage positions
wiped out and 380 billion in market
value gone in a matter of hours. On
Friday, Bitcoin dropped from 121,000 to
104,000 and 102 on some charts. Many
alts lost 50% or more of their value in
just 10 minutes. By every surface level
metric, it looked like a disaster. But
when you dig into what really happened,
who sold, who bought, and how the system
absorbed it, it starts to look less like
a collapse and more like a controlled
reset. In the span of one weekend, the
market flushed out record leverage,
tested every part of its infrastructure,
and then rebounded by more than half a
trillion dollars. So today guys, we're
breaking down exactly how this happened,
who might have pulled the strings and
why the shakeout could end up being the
cleanest setup of the entire cycle. Now
guys, I was watching this uh in in real
time uh play out. It was absolutely
mind-blowing. My my jaw was to the floor
and it was just insane to watch. But it
it didn't feel right. It felt so strange
because this news of tariffs wasn't
something new. We've been through it
before. So to me, something felt highly
manipulated. And we're going to find out
exactly what that was. The spark that
set this all off wasn't crypto. It was
geopolitics. A single misunderstanding
between two superpowers that spread like
wildfire through the markets. It started
early on October 9th. China's Ministry
of Commerce quietly announced a new
export controls on rare earth metals.
That material is used in AI chips,
electric vehicles, and advanced weapon
systems. Now, here's what most people
miss. Rare Earths aren't actually rare.
Finding them is easy. Processing them
isn't, though. China controls around 60%
of global mining and nearly 90% of
global refining capacity. That gives
Beijing massive leverage, especially in
the middle of a new tech arms race. At
first, the news barely made a ripple,
but by the next day, it was all over
right-wing financial feeds. post went
viral claiming China just weaponized the
rare earth supply chain. A direct quote
from one of the most shared tweets of
that morning. And then 26 hours later,
President Trump responded the only way
that he knows how. Through a truth
social post, he declared 100% tariffs on
all Chinese goods. One post, that's all
it took. The effect was immediate. The
Dow futures dropped 600 points within
minutes. Oil fell below $60 a barrel.
Bond yields collapsed and crypto trading
into the weekend with no circuit
breakers and no closing bell caught the
full blast. Within 30 minutes of that
post, Bitcoin fell $17,000.
All coins already liquid from the weeks
of low volatility started spiraling
down. But here's where things get, let's
just say, weird. According to the
Coallesi letter, crypto began selling
off more than an hour before Trump's
announcement. It's crazy, right? Wales
were already shorting. Big positions
were building. And it suggested this
wasn't just the panic. Someone knew what
was coming. That's the part that
separates this crash from every other.
Because what happened next, the insider
positioning, the exchange breakdowns,
and the liquidations didn't start with
fear. They started with precision. All
right, let's dig into that because the
deeper you go, the less random this all
looks. The craziest part of this entire
event is that the market started
crashing before the trigger was even
pulled. At 9:30 a.m. Eastern, Bitcoin
began to roll over a full hour before
Trump's tariff post. Wales were already
shorting the market in size. They
weren't reacting. They were positioning
ahead of time. By 4:30 p.m., just before
the US stock market closed, one whale
dropped another 23 million in short
orders, setting off the first big
liquidation wave. Then at 4:49 p.m.,
they doubled down with another position.
30 minutes later, Bitcoin hit its daily
lows. But here's where it gets
impossible to ignore. According to Marty
Party's analysis, an anonymous trader or
group of traders opened a massive short
position on Hyperliquid, one of crypto's
fastest growing decentralized
derivatives exchanges. Those accounts
were brand new, created that same
morning, and when the dust settled,
those trades had netted over $192
million in profit, closed perfectly
within minutes of the bottom. So either
someone made the most well-timed trade
in crypto history or more likely they
knew what was coming before anyone else.
Even the coallesie letter pointed out
the coincidence. The markets began
selling long before the tariff post.
This was planned. When you connect those
dots, the rare earth headline, the delay
before the tariff post, and the
preemptive shorting, you start to see a
pattern. Someone was waiting for the
signal. And once that signal hit, it
wasn't just traders reacting. It was the
algorithms executing, exchanges
autoliquidating, and the entire
structure of the market cracking all at
once. The first domino wasn't the tariff
post. It was the insider positioning
that came before it. What followed was
one of the fastest, most violent chain
reactions the crypto market has ever
seen. Look guys, my thoughts on this,
who is it, right? And it's got to be
Trump's inner circle. I don't think that
Trump is involved in this. I don't think
he knows. But I think that the things
that Trump is about to say publicly,
there's a small circle of people around
him that know all of this ahead of time.
And if you're anonymously trading on
Hyperlid, who's to know whose wallet
that is and who's opening these shorts?
But if you know the news before it
happens, gives you really good position
to make these huge kind of moves and
profit almost $200 million in 30
minutes. By the afternoon, it turned
into a chain reaction. By 5:20 p.m.
Eastern, Bitcoin printed a $20,000
candle to the downside. The biggest
intraday move in its history. 1.6
million traders were liquidated. Longs
outnumbered shorts 7 to1. It was a
mechanical flush. Not panic, not
sentiment, just algorithms purging
leverage at scale. Altcoins, which made
up most of the collateral for leverage
positions, all collapsed together.
Credible crypto explained it perfectly.
Once margin calls hit, every altcoin
used as collateral got autosold. That's
why everything from Salana to Cosmos
went vertically straight down. It was
forcelling at every layer of the system.
Guys, this reminds me like the first
thing I thought about when I saw this
happening was the COVID crash. And I
learned my lessons in the COVID crash.
For those of you guys who've been
following the channel for a long time,
you know that during the co crash, I was
irresponsibly long and leveraged through
a
liquidated and lost about 350 Bitcoin
that day. So, I learned my lesson. A ton
of people had to learn the lessons the
hard way this time in this crash. But
for me, it just taught me that I should
never leverage uh anything big,
certainly not altcoins. And so for me it
was just I was fine. I was chill because
I hold spot and chill. But if you're
using leverage, it's very very
dangerous. And most crypto traders are
irresponsibly using leverage 10, 15x,
20x, whatever. And that just a small
correction. And if you're in altcoins,
an event like this is so easy to happen
that you're really putting yourself at
risk. I mean, so many traders wiped out
their entire portfolio. There's stories
after stories on crypto Twitter right
now of people who lost everything. $30
million, $15 million, $9 million. I've
been reading them all weekend. As those
liquidations rippled through the system,
exchanges started breaking one after
another. Data feeds glitched. APIs went
offline. Users couldn't even log in to
buy the dip or close their short
positions if they wanted to. And that's
when the conspiracy theories started
flying. Rand Neuter laid it out pretty
clear. The crash began minutes after the
US markets closed at the most illquid
time of the week. Oracle network started
misfiring, reporting bad price data.
Market makers went dark. Exchanges froze
retail accounts. Even analytic sites
like Coin Glass and Coin Market Cap went
offline. It all felt coordinated, like
someone had pulled the plug on half of
the market at once. But then analysts
started digging into the onchain data
and what they found made it even
stranger. According to YQACCC's forensic
breakdown, the most catastrophic price
collapses happened on Binance where you
wouldn't have thought that it would have
been cuz it's typically the deepest
liquidity and only really on Binance.
Three specific assets, USDE, WBET,
and BN Soul, all crashed by more than
80%. At one point, WBET, which should
have tracked Ethereum, traded 88% below
its value. USDE, which is supposed to be
a stable coin and always be pegged at
$1. It dropped to 65. And BN Soul, a
wrap Salana derivative, collapsed to
$34, while Salana's spot price didn't
really move anywhere close to that.
Guys, that doesn't happen randomly. That
happens when liquidity is pulled from
the order book at the exact wrong
moment. Here's where it gets wild. Those
three tokens were the same ones Binance
had publicly announced would be getting
pricing mechanism updates scheduled for
October 14th, just days later. The crash
hit inside that vulnerability window.
Out of thousands of pairs, those three
imploded first, and that implosion was a
first domino to fall in what became
billions in liquidations across hundreds
of alts. The probability of that being a
coincidence, guys, it's almost zero. Was
it a coordinated attack? Was it an
opportunistic exploit? We still don't
know. But the pattern is clear. Someone
targeted the weakest link in the system.
And then when the chaos settled, Binance
stepped in. Within 48 hours, Solid Intel
confirmed that Binance covered $283
million in users losses from these deped
assets. Now,
is that the actual value of people lost?
maybe just in those assets alone, but
those assets caused the entire rest of
the market. And you can be sure that
more more than 283 million was
liquidated on Binance. So what about
those accounts? This was the largest
liquidation event in crypto history.
$19.3 billion in force liquidations. For
comparison, to put that in perspective,
the CO crash in March 2020 wiped out
just $1.2 billion. The Terra Luna
collapse burned around 5 billion. The
FTX meltdown about 2 billion. But
October 2025,
19.3 billion, nine times bigger than
FTX. Yet despite the scale, no major
exchange failed and no protocol
defaulted. That's new. According to
Glass Node, funding rates, the cost of
holding leverage positions dropped to
their lowest levels since 2022. Bare
market bottom. When you see that, you're
not looking at destruction. You're
looking at a complete reset. This was
the biggest force reset in modern market
history. And it left crypto cleaner,
stronger, and more liquid than before.
Historically, every time we've seen the
signal, the next major rally followed
right after. It's the same blueprint we
saw post FTX and postco. But guys, yes,
buying over the weekend on Saturday or
something would have been an amazing
opportunity, but I'm still not convinced
that it's up only from here. You know,
we're we're going to see. And uh for me,
I didn't buy anything. Well, mostly
because I don't have any dry powder on
the side. So, I didn't really buy
anything. I would have loved to have
bought stuff, but I'm still waiting for
bullish momentum to continue because if
this is the reset that we expect it to
be and we do go into a wild Q4 where
things go way up, it's not going to
matter if you bought Salana at 150 or
175 or even 200 because it's probably
going to $1,000. The same is true for
the other ones. everything else is going
to go up. Ridiculous if we continue to
see this Q4 rally and this insane
altcoin run that we expect to see. And
then came the biggest plot twist. 2 days
after President Trump's tariff post
caused global panic, he reversed course.
China clarified their statement. Not a
ban. Applications that meet regulations
will be approved. And then Vice
President Vance echoed that tone. We
appreciate the friendship between Trump
and President Xi. And right before
futures open on Sunday night, Trump
posted on True Social, guys. Check this
out. Don't worry about China. It'll all
be fine. And the follow-through came
fast. This morning, the Kobe letter
reported that administration officials
were already walking everything back.
Treasury Secretary Scott Passent went
live on TV saying the 100% tariffs don't
have to happen. And aids told reporters
the USChina relationship is good. That
confirms the entire timeline. The market
never reacted to China's original
statement. Trump misinterpreted it.
China clarified and now his own team is
reversing course. The message from
Washington is clear. Escalation is off
the table and policy risk is melting
away. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is
exactly what the markets wanted to hear.
The same account that triggered the
crash flipped the market back to
bullish. Just as Kobesi predicted using
his 11step tariff playbook, he said it
perfectly. Step one, cryptic tariff
post. Step two, panic. Step six, Sunday
night resolution. Step 10, announce a
new trade deal and then new highs. Guys,
right now we're on step six. By the time
the dust settled, the market did what it
always does. When panic goes too far. It
snapped back fast. Within 40 hours of
hitting bottom, more than 550 billion in
market value had returned to crypto.
That's one of the fastest recoveries in
history. Bitcoin rebounded back above
115,000. Alex Becker summed it up well
as well. The COVID and the FTX crash
were the two best buying days of the
decade. Yesterday will probably be the
third. And history might agree. Every
major leverage wipeout in Bitcoin's
history. March 2020, May 2021, November
2022 led to higher highs within months.
This one had all the same markers.
Extreme liquidations, negative funding,
historic volume, and then a sharp
V-shaped recovery. the same pattern just
repeated but at scale 10 times larger.
So guys about playing this dip and
playing this opportunity perfectly. I
definitely wouldn't be longing anything.
I probably wouldn't be shorting
anything. It just we don't know how the
market's going to react moving forward.
More than likely, my bet is that it goes
up. Maybe we see another correction.
That's possible. But for me, I'm just
holding my spot positions that I've been
in up until now and waiting for things
to come back into a into profit
essentially. And I think that's going to
happen, but whether it happens this week
or next week, the week after, I'm not
really sure. But it does still seem like
the bull market is on because that's one
thing that a lot of people are
questioning. I saw this all over crypto
Twitter is, is the bull market over? Was
that the top? And it now we're starting
and now we've seen today's rally back
that it's definitely does not look like
the top at all. It seems like the dip
that reset the whole system and ready
for the next leg up. And now that the
leverage is gone and the systems reset,
the next question is simple. Where is
the money going next? Because while
everyone was staring at charts, the
rotation had already begun. The first
clear sign came from BNB. Right after
the flush, it was one of the first
majors to turn green. And not just a
small bounce. It outperformed Bitcoin,
Ethereum, and nearly every large cap alt
by doubledigit percentages. That
surprised a lot of traders. But when you
look at what's happening under the hood,
it makes perfect sense. BNB's ecosystem
has been quietly going parabolic. Its
memecoin launchpad for meme just flipped
Pump Fund on Salana, capturing over 80%
of all new token creation. On October
8th, it saw 47,000 new tokens minted in
a single day and over $3 billion in
trading volume and nearly $4 million in
fees collected. And now, institutional
money is circling. According to Coin
Bureau, China's Renaissance Bank is
reportedly in talks to raise $600
million for a new fund to invest in B&B.
And this only adds even more tailwinds
to Binance's continued outperformance.
But rotation never stays in one place
for long. As B&B starts to lead, Salana
could be right behind it. Even during
the crash, when oracles failed and
exchanges froze, Salana held fairly
steady. That's why analysts are already
calling for the next wave of capital
rotation from B&B into Salana. It's the
same cycle every time. Smart money buys
fear, then retail follows liquidity. B&B
and Salana are now ground zero for both.
So, while the headlines still talk about
market uncertainty, onchain data is
already flashing one clear signal,
rotation seasons back on. Yeah. So, B&B
has been absolutely crushing it lately
and the price has just gone absolute
parabolic. everything in the BNB
ecosystem is pumping like crazy. I don't
know. For me personally, I I've been
hesitant to to deploy over there even
though things are just crushing. It
feels like maybe one of these rotations
of narrative. You know, you had Aster
that rolled out. It brought a lot of
attention to B&B chain and now people
are just warping B&B chain. All the BNB
related memes are ripping over there and
I've they're running like crazy. But for
me, I'm going to wait and see what
happens over there. I'm not going to
chase green candles and uh certainly not
on memes right now. While retail
panicked, long-term holders distributed
240,000 Bitcoin, the largest sale since
January. But prices are still holding
strong. That's because ETFs and
institutions soaked up supply.
Cointelegraph reported 19 new corporate
Bitcoin holders this month. That's
insane. That brings a total to 346
corporate Bitcoin holders. That's
adoption accelerating right through
volatility. And Ral Pal said it
perfectly. All of this is just noise if
you're not leveraged, which I'm not.
Right? If tomorrow's world is more
digital than today's, the rest is just
headlines. Buy the BTFD and don't
this up. He said, "Buy the dip and don't
f this up." That's the real message. If
the liquidity cycle still expanding and
the technology curve is still rising,
dips like this are blessings, not
curses. So guys, I think that as Bitcoin
becomes a more globally accepted store
of value, uh, as a as Deutschbank said,
Bitcoin will likely be on central bank
balance sheets along with gold side by
side by 2030. All these institutions who
are basically taking the first move to
swap out some of their crappy fiat for
Bitcoin. Uh, this is long-term
conviction. And we're starting to see
now now 346 Bitcoin treasuries, which is
amazing amazing to see. This is
institutional adoption happening at
scale. This entire episode from the
tariff post to the flash crash will be
studied for years. It started with a
miscommunication of Google Translate
between world leaders that triggered a
billion dollar insider trade and ended
with the largest leverage purge in
crypto history. And in 72 hours, the
market reset itself. A misunderstanding
caused $2.5 trillion in global equity
losses. 380 billion in crypto wiped out.
And yet by Monday, the system will look
healthier than before. That's evolution.
Crypto just passed its biggest stress
test yet. And if history rhymes, this
might be the start of something much,
much bigger. When you look at every
metric, funding, leverage, RSI levels,
open interest, and the institutional
flows, everything screams reset. So, as
everyone debates manipulation, or
coincidence, the real story is what
comes next. And that's all we really
need to care about. The data says the
foundation's stronger. the pipelines are
clear and the next big leg might already
be forming. So guys, stay early, stay
informed, and stay positioned because
what we just lived through wasn't the
end of the bull run. It was a reset that
every bull run needs. So remember guys,
stay sharp, keep stacking your
satoshi's, and I'll catch you guys on
the next one. See you.
