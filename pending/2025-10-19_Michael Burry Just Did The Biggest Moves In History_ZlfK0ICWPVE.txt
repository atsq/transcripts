If you followed markets for a while, you
know one name that keeps showing up
whenever things get interesting. Michael
Bur. The man who called the housing
crash before almost anyone else. But
recently, he's been making moves so big
and so unusual that even veteran
investors are double-checking the
filings. Over the past 2 years, Bur has
practically written a playbook on how to
read the market's mood. From massive
index shorts to bold value buys, from
hedged bets on China to a complete
reversal into bullish calls, every step
has told a story about what he sees
coming next. And now his latest filings
reveal what might be the biggest series
of portfolio shifts in his entire
career. So today, we're breaking down
what those seven moves actually mean,
why he made them, what they say about
the market right now, and how regular
investors can use the same logic without
taking the same risks. So, let's step
into Q2 2023, where it all started, and
discover why his first move felt like a
gamble. But what came next looks like
prophecy. Back in quarter 2, 2023,
Michael Bur did something that sent
shock waves through the investing world.
For years, he'd warned that markets were
overheated. But this time, he didn't
just talk about it. He went allin. When
Scan Asset Management's filings dropped
that summer, they showed put options on
the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ 100 big
enough to make any trader blink. Each
position had a massive number of shares.
On paper, that was a combined notional
exposure of about $1.6 billion.
That's billion with a B. To put that
scale in perspective, Scion's entire
reported portfolio at the time was worth
roughly $1.7 billion, meaning almost the
whole thing was tied to the idea that
the market would fall. It was one of the
most aggressive macro hedges ever
disclosed by a single manager. The
timing looked bold, even reckless.
Inflation was cooling. The Federal
Reserve was hinting at pausing rate
hikes and investors were rushing back
into risk assets. The S&P had climbed
nearly 15% in the first half of the
year. Tech stocks were roaring and yet
Bur was essentially saying, "You're all
too early." So, did it pay off? Not
immediately. The market kept rising
through the rest of the year, which
means those massive puts probably lost
value unless he traded in and out
quickly. But that's not the point. This
move wasn't about a quick profit. It was
Burcasting his view that Euphoria had
returned too soon. And right after that,
instead of doubling down, he did
something that surprised even longtime
followers. He started to get surgical.
After his billiondoll market short, most
people expected Bur to dig in deeper.
But that's not what he did. In the next
quarter, Q32023,
he changed tactics from swinging a
sledgehammer to using a scalpel. When
Cyan's new filing hit the SEC database,
those giant index puts were gone.
Instead, the portfolio showed a handful
of targeted bearish positions,
especially in sectors that had run too
hot. He opened put options on the
EyesShares Semiconductor ETF, SOXX,
worth about $47 million, and another set
of puts on Booking Holdings, BKNG, for
$7.7 million in exposure. He also went
long on BKNG around 1,500 shares,
roughly $4.5 million, creating what
traders call a paired position. He owned
the stock, but carried a hedge against
it. That's sophisticated risk
management, not blind bearishness. And
to balance things out, he added small
value plays like NextStar Media and a
few shipping and industrial names,
companies that actually earn money when
global trade picks up. Essentially, Bur
had gone from betting against everything
to betting against specific bubbles.
Semiconductors at nosebleleed valuations
and travel stocks priced for perfection.
The market, meanwhile, kept pushing
higher. The S&P up another 8% in the
quarter, which means these surgical puts
probably didn't hit big, but they
weren't supposed to. They were insurance
precision instruments meant to survive a
market meltup until reality caught up.
By the end of 2023, something shifted in
Michael Bur's mindset. After a year of
precise hedges and cautious skepticism,
the man who once shorted the world
started buying it back piece by piece.
In the fourth quarter of 2023, Michael
Bur built a diversified long book that
looked almost optimistic. He bought into
Alphabet with 35,000 shares worth about
$4.9 million, Amazon with 30,000 shares
for roughly 4.6 6 million. Oracle with
50,000 shares at about 5.3 million and
HCA Healthcare with 20,000 shares valued
near 5.4 million. Then came the real
surprise, China. For the first time in
years, Bur opened meaningful positions
in Alibaba worth $5.8 million and
JD.com, roughly 201,000 shares valued at
5.8 million. While Western investors
were fleeing Chinese equities after a
brutal 2-year slump, Bur was buying the
fear. This quarter marked his return to
fundamentals. He was building a barbell
portfolio. On one side, cash flow
machines like Oracle and HCA. On the
other, deeply undervalued growth in
China's e-commerce giants. The S&P 500
ended the year up around 24%. The Nasdaq
up 43% while China's CSY 300 was still
down about 12%. In other words, Bur was
buying into what most investors had
written off. So, was he early or wrong?
That depends on your timeline.
Historically, Bur buys when pain is
fresh and holds until logic wins. This
quarter wasn't about a quick rebound. It
was a rebuild, one that would set the
stage for his next 2 years of
conviction. And as 2024 began, those
convictions only got stronger. By early
2024, Michael Bur's portfolio had
started to look less like a hedge fund
playbook and more like a value
investor's diary. When his first quarter
202413 Filing dropped, the message was
clear. He wasn't backing down from China
or healthcare. His largest positions
were JD.com with about 360,000 shares
worth roughly 9.9 million. Alibaba with
one 125,000 shares valued near 9
million. HCA Healthcare with 25,000
shares worth about 8.3 million and Croup
with 125,000 shares for roughly 7.9
million. These picks told a story. JD
and Alibaba represented undervalued
growth in an economy most investors had
written off. While HCA and Molina
Healthcare offered stable, cash flow
rich businesses that can survive any
economic weather. It was a classic
barbell strategy. risk on one side,
defense on the other. Then came the
second quarter of 2024, and Bur doubled
down, not recklessly, but deliberately.
His exposure to China grew even larger
with his combined stakes in Alibaba and
JD.com now worth well over $17 million.
It was a bold move at a time when
sentiment toward Chinese stocks was near
rock bottom. To balance that risk, he
added Molina Healthcare and Shift 4
payments. Two positions together worth
just over $14 million. One was a classic
Bur pick, steady cash flow, consistent
earnings, while the other tapped into
the post-pandemic surge in digital
transactions. Did these trades pay off
immediately? Not really. Both Alibaba
and JD remained sluggish, but the
healthcare names performed far better.
that offset some of the China drag,
showing Bur's logic in balancing offense
and defense. To most people, his
portfolio looked confusing, but in
reality, it was consistent. He was
betting on mean reversion that cheap
assets eventually rise and expensive
narratives eventually fall. And as
global headlines about China got darker,
Bur started hedging, not to exit, but to
stay. He wasn't abandoning his
positions, he was hedging them. In
Scan's third quarter 2413F filings, it
showed something few investors ever try,
holding the same stocks, both long and
short. He owned Alibaba, JD.com, and
BYU, but also held put options against
each of them. In total, those long
positions represented tens of millions,
and the matching puts almost the same
amount. It was classic Bur conviction
without complacency. To most traders,
that might look contradictory, but it
was actually smart risk control, a way
to stay in the trade without losing
sleep. He still believed these companies
were undervalued, but he no longer
trusted the global backdrop. This was
Bur saying, "I'll wait for the payoff,
but I'll protect my downside while I
do." At the same time, his defensive
core kept growing. By the fourth
quarter, he had built meaningful stakes
in Estee Lauder and VFC Corp. while
rebying his longtime healthcare
favorites, HCA Healthcare and Molina
Healthcare. Together, these formed a
balanced foundation. Consumer brands for
recovery, healthc care for stability,
and hedged China for contrarian upside.
It was one of Bur's most complex but
balanced setups ever that could survive
almost any market mood swing.
Performance-wise, the hedges likely cost
him in the short term. China's ADRs
drifted sideways while US indices hit
new highs. But the protection meant he
could hold conviction without
capitulating. Just when the world
thought Michael Bur had turned into a
calm fundamentalsonly investor, he
flipped the chessboard. His first
quarter 202513F
filing showed one of the boldest and
most concentrated bearish bets of his
entire career. Almost his entire book
turned upside down. Put options on AI
leaders, Chinese tech, and e-commerce
giants everywhere you looked. The
biggest shock was his Nvidia position.
Put contracts tied to 900,000 shares, a
notional value of about 97.5 million.
Then came a string of others. Alibaba
puts worth roughly 26.5 million. JD.com
puts around 16.5 million. Pindu Duo puts
about 23.7 million. BYU puts near 9.2
million. And Trip.com puts roughly 12.7
million. Altogether, it added up to more
than $185 million in downside exposure
declared in a single quarter. And on the
long side, just one stock, Estee Lauder,
about $200,000 shares valued at roughly
$13 million. That was it. Everything
else screamed defense. When that filing
hit the news, the headlines lit up. Bur
bets against the AI boom. It made sense.
Nvidia's stock had rocketed from about
$18 in late March to around $158 by the
end of June. Those puts were likely deep
in the red, at least on paper. But that
was never the point. His move was more
than just a trade. It was a
philosophical statement against AI
mania, against market complacency, and
against the illusion that stocks only
move one way. He'd done something
similar before the housing crash. And
even though he was early back then too,
history proved his logic sound. But this
time, even that wasn't the final chapter
because just three months later, Bur
would pull off one of the fastest and
most dramatic reversals of his life,
flipping from total pessimism to
full-blown optimism. And that's when his
moves truly earned the title, the
biggest in history. When science
Q2202513F
filing came out, those massive puts were
gone. In their place, call options,
bullish bets across healthcare, quality
growth, and even the same Chinese stocks
he'd been shorting just months earlier.
The numbers were massive. He held calls
on United Health worth about $19
million, Regeneron around $15 million,
Lululemon roughly $95 million, Meta
Platforms about 74 million, and ASML
around 20 million. He also bought calls
on JD.com and Alibaba, together worth
over $60 million, and added VFC Corp
calls valued at around $17 million,
turning last quarter's defensive holding
into a bet on recovery. In total, his
reported portfolio jumped to about $578
million, one of the biggest quarterly
increases of his entire career. Context
matters here. The timing made sense. By
late spring, the Federal Reserve had
started signaling rate cuts. Inflation
cooled to roughly 2.6% and recession
fears were fading. Healthc care stocks
were cheap, AI names had paused, and
sentiment was finally shifting from fear
back to optimism. Bur saw an opening
that most investors ignored. The window
between panic and recovery. It was a
gutsy move, but completely consistent
with how he thinks. When you take a step
back and look at everything Bur's done
over the past 2 years, it all starts to
make sense. Every move, the big shorts,
the careful hedges, the long plays, the
China bets, the AI puts, and finally the
bullish calls all connect like a
sequence. Think of it this way. In the
second quarter of 2023, Bur shorted the
market. In the third, he fine-tuned
those bets. By the fourth, he began
building real value positions. Then in
2024, he started defending them with
hedges. In the first quarter of 2025, he
turned bearish again as markets got too
confident. And by the second quarter, he
flipped bullish just as fear peaked.
That's not indecision. That's
understanding how cycles work. And the
numbers tell the same story. Over eight
quarters, Scion's reported portfolio
value moved from about $1.7 billion
during his index hedges in 2023, down to
77 million after he cut risk in 2024,
and then back up to 578 million by mid
2025. It's not about the size of the
capital, it's about the conviction
behind each shift. He wasn't wrong to
short in 2023. The S&P's price
toearnings ratio was around 28, nearly
double its long-term average. He wasn't
wrong to hedge China in 2024. The
country's growth slowed to just over 4%
and money was rushing out. And he wasn't
wrong to flip bullish in 2025. While
everyone expected a recession, he saw a
window of opportunity as the Fed
signaled lower rates. Put together,
Bur's timeline doesn't read like a
trader's diary. It reads like a road map
of how markets and people behave. He's
not chasing trends. He's watching fear
and greed take turns driving the wheel.
The pattern is simple. Whenever risk
gets out of balance, Bur steps in.
Sometimes by shorting belief, other
times by buying panic. And when the
crowd swings too far in one direction,
that's when he makes his move. It's not
luck, it's logic. And that logic is
what's kept him relevant long after the
big short made him famous. But the real
question is, what can you take from all
that? Because let's be real, most of us
aren't managing billion-dollar
portfolios or filing complex 13F reports
every quarter. But that's not the point.
What really matters isn't the size of
the trades. It's the logic behind them.
The biggest lesson here is about
discipline under uncertainty. When
everyone else was getting greedy, the
smart move was building protection. When
fear took over, the right play was to
stay invested but manage the risk. And
when panic was at its peak, that's when
opportunity showed up. That cycle,
hedge, hold, attack, works for anyone
who wants to invest with intention
instead of emotion. For normal
investors, that might simply mean
keeping a bit of cash on hand when the
market feels unstoppable or adding to
solid cash flow rich companies when the
news turns gloomy. It could mean using
basic protective steps like stop losses,
diversification, or a simple index
hedge, not to predict every crash, but
to stay calm when volatility hits. Even
Bur's China trades highlight something
useful. You don't have to abandon a
belief just because the crowd turns
against it. You can reduce your
exposure, hedge it, or just wait it out.
The key is staying logical instead of
reactive. And that's really what
separates thoughtful investors from
impulsive ones. So, the next time you
see a headline about a big investor
betting against the world, remember it's
not about predicting every move. It's
about understanding where fear and greed
are mispriced and acting with clarity
when others can't. Want to know
