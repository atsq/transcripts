And if you look at private equity, pull
up that chart I had there. This is just
stunning how big this industry is
getting. You know, $5 trillion is what
we're up to here. And it just keeps
growing.
>> I I think private equity is totally
screwed. I I don't think Silver Lake or
Infinity or this deal
are screwed, but I think private equity
in general is totally hosed.
>> All right. Well, it's gotten huge just
since 2015 and tripling in size. So why
is this I guess my question for the
gentleman here and for the audience why
is private equity becoming so large and
what impact does that have on society if
people can't put EA into their
retirement account? They can't put
Stripe into their retirement account. If
we take all the great companies and we
start to privatize them, SpaceX never
goes public. What impact does that have
on people's retirement accounts?
>> Okay, look I think I think the history
of this is important. There was a
long-standing belief that the best way
to generate the best risk adjusted
return. What does that mean? That means
to manage through periods where the
stock markets go down and to manage
through periods of volatility. The best
way to do that was to have what's called
a 60/40 allocation. 60% to bonds and 40%
to equities. Over many years, especially
when we artificially suppressed rates at
zero through Obama, a lot of people
started to move their allocations away
from 60/40 and they started to make more
and more investments further out on the
risk curve. The biggest beneficiaries of
that were venture capital, private
equity, and hedge funds.
The thing with private equity is that
because rates were zero, they had an
infinite amount of borrowing capacity,
had very little downside to them, and so
they were able to manufacture returns
much faster than venture capital and
hedge funds could. So, as a result, you
had an initial group of people that were
defining the asset class, making a ton
of money, and then you had all these
fast followers that said, "Well, if
they're doing it, I can do it, too. So
far, so good." But then always what
happens is then you have this flood of
lagards that just flood the zone. And
it's these lagards that make it very
difficult to generate returns because
they start overpaying for assets. They
start mismanaging and undermanaging the
assets that they do own. And so where we
are is that private equity has seen a
very consistent way of returning money
to help improve that 60/40 portfolio. as
a result they got a lot of money but
then that created a lot of competition
and so that's why you see this hockey
stick graph Jason and when you see that
kind of graph
>> it doesn't matter what asset class it is
the returns go to zero and so we've seen
this in venture capital
>> we've seen this in hedge funds
>> and we're now going to see this in
private equity
>> too much money going in to be clear what
you're saying means you kind of exit it
right there's there's no returns and so
again I've said in any of these
alternative asset classes, there's only
one thing you should always ask if you
had to have one critical question.
What are your distributions?
Don't show me your IRRa. What is your
DPI?
>> The distributions on your paidin
capital. And if the answer is zero,
then it is a very challenged asset
class. And what I will tell you in
private equity is that over the last
four or five years,
distributions have been few and far
between.
So I think what's going to happen is
that the money is going to come out of
private equity and it's going to get
concentrated into the few companies that
know what they're doing of which
Silverlake has generated over you know
the last 15 20 years
tens and tens of billions of dollars of
distributions. They are just an
exceptionally well-run organization.
They've done these huge buyout deals
successfully before. So, we need to go
through that in PE. Where does the money
go? The money's already leaked into
private credit, which is the next big
bubble that's building. It looks like
this chart that you just showed,
which is loaning businesses money. You
know, it's super interesting because you
make such a good point. What we're
seeing in private equity is these
continuation funds. Now continuation
funds are coming chimoth to venture. So
I've been getting pitched on these
continuation funds where like hey take
all your assets sell it to a new group
of people and then reset the clock and
then there's never an exit. The good
news is I will say the last year we've
seen a lot more activity for shares of
our companies that are still private. So
the secondary market freeberg is coming
back in a major way. But I do get
worried about these continuation funds
because now you're just moving an asset
from one class to the other and we need
to have a functioning IPO market. How
functioning is the IPO market today?
Would we say it's completely
dysfunctional?
>> How dysfunctional is the IPO market? Let
me say it another way. And and how do we
correct that? And this leads into your
new spec.
>> Look, there are three ways to go public.
There's the traditional way IPO,
there's the direct listing, and then
there's the reverse merger or the spa.
Up until I floated IPO A in 2018, I
think it was the first way was really
the only way.
I was involved in two direct listings,
Slack and Coinbase.
And in both of those, what I learned is
that, you know, it has the same vagaries
as the traditional IPO. So in the
traditional IPO, you go to a bank, they
underwrite you, they act as a
gatekeeper, and they take six, seven, 8%
fees as a result, and then they allocate
what is essentially underpriced stock to
their best customers. Then you see a
one-day pop, maybe a two or three day
pop. All of those customers tend to
unload and then the stock tends to drift
down. So the IPO is expensive and it
typically is mispriced.
The direct listing
you have a different dynamic which is
the first trade is always the highest
trade and then it just goes straight
down. That happened with Slack and it
happened with Coinbase. So
>> Spotify would be in that group as well.
Yeah.
>> Yeah. With Slack I remember like I I was
like offside a billion dollars and I was
like well I'm never letting this happen
again. And so when I had the Coinbase
thing, I sold it the first day. And I
texted Brian. I said, "This is not a
directional indication of your company.
It's the dynamics of the direct listing
because I learned it the hard way that
the time to sell is on day one." So
where does the spack come in, you know,
especially now in version two? Version
two being the the thing that I have been
tinkering and refining with and am
trying to push in in this new version.
I think that it's creating an incredibly
competitive vehicle where you can have a
ton of money go into these private
companies, take them public at a very,
very low cost of capital. And I think
that that's should be very enticing.
>> So, you closed your financing. Can you
just tell us what the capital raise was
like as you went out and met with folks?
What do you hear?
>> Yes. You know, Nick, maybe you can find
it. You know that image of the Raptor
engines?
>> Yes. super complex to being elegantly
simple.
>> Yeah. Nick, can you can you maybe just
throw that up? What I would say is like
Spack 1.0, of which I was, you know,
right in the front of the parade, had a
bunch of misfires and it was
complicated, but it worked. There were
some hot fires that worked, but then
there were some clear misfires. And the
whole point was to prove that you could
create a competitive alternative to the
IPO. The thing that I'm the most proud
of quite honestly is
for all intents and purposes I started
a normalization of this vehicle that's
now raised more than 1502 200 billion
dollars for American companies. I am
very proud of them. That's an important
thing for the American capital markets.
I think what we did in American
exceptionalism is Raptor 2. It's not yet
perfect, but I do think it tries to
improve on the things that I noticed was
not working in Raptor 1. And in that is
a lot of the compensation and
incentives. And so when I showed that to
investors, they were quite excited. I
think that they want a competitive IPO
market that brings many many American
businesses to the public market so that
they can be owned by everybody, the
transparency they like, and the fact
that the incentives are such now where
there's absolutely no compensation
unless this thing really works. And
historically they received warrants in
the company typically with a strike
price of 1150. So 15% above the issue
price of the stock
>> and founders shares that were basically
>> and there was founder shares. But like
did you have a reaction from them saying
hey we want some
>> warrants we we need a little extra
kicker here like there's some sort of
desire for that.
>> No in fact it was the opposite. I think
that the institutional investors and you
know my investors in this 98.7 of the
capital was allocated to these guys are
the best of the best. You you know who
they are. So they're every single blue
chip A+ institutional investor and what
they wanted was great companies. They
want great companies to be public and
the reason is the thing that Freeberg I
think you mentioned this before. When a
good company gets public, the amount of
money that they can raise in the publics
and then the amount of growth that they
have in the publics far outclasses what
they'll ever do as a private company.
And so they want the simplest and
cheapest way of great businesses to get
out. Jamat, do you think that the
transaction when you find a merger
partner, the traditional spa has been
announced as a merger concurrent with a
pipe being done where new investors are
underwriting the valuation of the deal
and saying we like this company at this
price cuz we are now going to write
money in in the form of a pipe and
historically the pipe was for common
shares. So it kind of was like this is a
good price and everyone felt good about
it. Number one, do you anticipate that
there'll still be a pipe being done in
concurrent with the merger and this
transaction? And then number two is do
you think it'll look like a common pipe?
Because after the spa frenzy died down,
in order to get deals done, the pipe
started to get done with convertible
preferred securities. So they were
senior to common and they almost were
like dead. How do you think this is
going to play out? because a clean deal
has not happened in quite some time
where a spa has announced a merger and
simply raised money via common in the
form of a pipe.
>> It's a great question. I think it comes
down to the underlying asset, but there
are some incredible companies that are
private
that if they go public
will be able to demand
common pipe capital. I think that the
future maybe just prognosticating and
guessing what does Raptor 3 look like in
this back. I think the Raptor 3 will
look like where somebody a sponsor like
me rolls everything up into one thing so
that it's already pre-wired from the
beginning where I'll just speak to
a billion, two billion, three billion,
whatever it is, flexible capital that
can come in as common so that it's a
totally pre-baked IPO
>> at a very fair price. I think that I
think that that's what the Raptor 3
version of a spa will look like.
>> So more capital and then they they put
their full trust and faith in the
sponsor to run the deal. Well, no then
no meaning then there's no conversion
risk that all the money comes over right
from day comes over right and so then
you have to fully commit
