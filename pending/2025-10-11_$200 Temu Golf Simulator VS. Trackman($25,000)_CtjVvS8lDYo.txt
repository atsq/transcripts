I went on Tameu and bought their least
expensive launch monitor for $200. And I
have the world's most expensive golf
launch monitor. Bro, we share bank
accounts. How much did you pay for that?
Trackman costs $25,000.
Bro, what the

Today we're comparing golf launch
monitors. We're going to give an honest
review from this dinghy $200 piece of
swami from TAMU and the world's best
Trackman launch monitor. Let's get it.
Get a job, bro. Yeah, you're going to
need it. Pay off that thing. This TAMU
golf launch monitor sits 5 ft behind the
golfer. And they were so generous as to
give us a ruler. $200. Ruler is barely
in the budget. Now that we've identified
5 ft behind the golf ball using our
fancy ruler, all we do is take the stand
out from the back of the golf launch
monitor and hold down the power button
for two seconds. You'll hear the beep
and you're ready to go. You can also
change clubs. You just hit the button on
the right side, hold it down, and it
keeps changing. Right now, we're on
Onewood, which is driver, all the way
down. Hybrids, irons. We're going to
start with pitching wedge.
Wa! What just happened? Trackman has a
built-in stand and watch. I can put my
hand under here. Did it just level
itself? Trackman ASMR.
$25,000. This is what it'll get you. And
we're ready to go. Oh my god. So, all we
do to set up TrackMan is connect to the
Wi-Fi. I'm now connected to my Trackman.
Go back into the Trackman app. Trackman
spits out an image of where we are going
to hit the golf balls from with a
crosshairs of setting the target. We can
hit anywhere in that blue area. We're
going to change the type of ball from
floater to a premium golf ball.
>> Bro, I don't even think that the TAMU
launch monitor even cares what kind of
ball you're hitting. You can set
temperature, too.
>> It is 84Â°. So, afterwards, we will be in
the tub and altitude. We are at 100 ft
above sea level. Create the player, the
Chill Twins, and Trackman will recognize
whether you're hitting or I'm hitting
because we're lefty and righty, and
it'll automatically adjust to which
dexterity we are hitting with. Here are
all the club selections. We will start
with a pitching wedge. These are all the
parameters that Trackman calculates.
Since your TAMU launch monitor can only
calculate three numbers, we will only
calculate club speed, smash factor,
which is ball speed divided by club head
speed, and carry distance with a
pitching wedge to start. Thank you.
Let's keep it within the budget. We're
aiming at that American flag, correct?
>> Yes. Aim for freedom.
[Music]
So, let's see how accurate these are.
142 on the TAMU Trackman 134.8 and the
smash factor way different club speed
way different. All right, let's try
another one.
That's more accurate club head speed.
The club head speed was within a mile an
hour. Carry distance is way off. I can
tell you it felt like a poor hit. And if
I go on to track man over here, you
could tell where I hit it on the face.
It was towards the huzzle, the club, the
heel right there. Ju is not going to
tell me that, but I can feel it. There's
no way I hit that pitching wedge 149
yards. Absolutely no. No way. Let me hit
one. All right, let's see if it works
for lefties. All right, let's try some
five irons.
[Music]
How much was that? We have 199 Swami
carry, 181 Trackman carry. Okay. So,
we're sitting at 10 mph difference with
clubhead speed. So, that's a huge
difference.
>> Yeah.
[Music]
Okay. So, TAMU carry 199 again. Trackman
carry was 185. Club head speed was 97 on
the TAMU. Club head speed on Trackman
was 93 and A2. Smash factor was close.
132 on TAMU, 137 on Trackman.
>> Okay, let me sting one.
[Music]
209 yd carry with the TAMU. Okay. Okay.
So, 95 club head speed on TAMU and 92 on
Trackman. So, that was close. But again,
look, look at we're still look at the
smash factor. It's 14 over here on the
Swami TAMU and 141. So, it's really
really accurate.
>> Okay. But every single time, Trackman is
13 to 17 yd shorter than Tamu because of
the club head speed. All right, my turn.
Let's try another five iron.
[Music]
That's solid. Frank that one good. 211.
Thank you. Boom. Tamu 211. Trackman 187.
But the smash factors are close. 94 1/2
mph on the club head speed on Trackman
and 98 on TAMU. How is the TAMU spinning
out of smash factor if it doesn't know
ball speed? It must know ball speed
somehow. Or maybe it's making carry
distance off of smash factor. Try one
more.
No way I hit that 223. I mean, I wish I
did, but jeez, Frankie. Boom. Boom. All
right, so the club head speed is 6 miles
an hour off. Easy. Way off. TAMU is
registering a higher club head speed on
average of about 5 mph, 6 mph every
single time, which makes the TAMU carry
greater than the Trackman. Let's try
some drivers.
You won't tank the iPad. You're fine. Is
it Swami on?
>> Yeah. I don't know.
What the hell happened? You can't hardly
see the screen now. It's dimmed. Oh, you
can barely see it. Don't even see it. Be
sure to hit it in your back swing. I
want to smash that. Let's just see what
the difference is.
>> 264
>> 264 118 club head speed. Trackman's 109.
Wow.
>> There's no way. 118 mph, bro. I'm just
getting warmed up. That was 9 mph off
and it was only 5 yds off. There's no
way.
[Music]
Solid shot. 271 carry on the TAMU. 255
carry on Trackman. That was Trackman was
right.
>> The TAMU is reading higher distances
than club head speeds every single time.
>> With driver, it's easily 10 mph off. You
try one.
[Music]
It's a little right. Mhm. 270 carry on
TAMU. 256 carry on Trackman.
>> It was still 13 yds. 14 yds carry off.
>> All right, let me step on one.
[Music]
Club head speed on Trackman 108. Club
head speed on TAMU 112. 4 miles an hour
difference. Carry distance on TAMU 282.
Carry distance on Trackman 268.
>> Frank, the TAU is spitting out the carry
distance before the ball gets to apex.
>> It's always measuring 3 to 5 mph higher
club
>> at least than Trackman all the time.
>> That's good to know cuz if you're
playing around with this thing with
yardages on the driving range and then
you go out on the course, you better
club up if you're using this TAU launch
monitor.
Bro, what happened to my TU golf launch
monitor? You can't see the screen
anymore. What happened, bro? Maybe if I
throw it to you like a football, the
screen will come on. Go long.
Did it come back on? Oh my god, it came
back on.
>> What? What do we do now?
>> Outro. All I do to close up this TAMU
golf launch monitor is kick in the stand
and hold off the off button and I put it
right back in my pocket. As long as the
screen stays on, it might be worth the
$200. As long as now we know that the
TAMU reads feelgood launch monitor
information relative to what's actually
going on.
Close up the legs and we're good to go.
How can we be so sure that Trackman's
data is so accurate? We have been using
Trackman for over a decade and we've
compared Trackman's data with real time
data in real life on an actual golf
course up to 400 yards. It is within a
yard every single time and we've tested
it with laser rangefinders for accuracy.
The huge upside to the TAMU golf launch
monitor is you fit it right back in your
pocket and you can even swing with it in
your pocket. Bro, I don't think you're
going to be able to fit Trackman in your
pocket. So, I'll take my TAMU simulator
to the bank.
>> I'll take my $25,000 Trackman to the
bank and sell it. We share bank
accounts.
[Music]
>> So, actually, we spent 12,500 a piece.
When you're a twin, everything is cut in
half
>> or doubled. Since everything is doubled
as twins, smash that like button. Let's
get this video over a million views.
Comment below your experience on golf
launch monitors and what you think is
the best one in the market. Stay chill.
