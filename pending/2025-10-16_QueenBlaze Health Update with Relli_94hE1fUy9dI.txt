got blurry camera.
>> Uh, hold on one sec, y'all. Got a blurry
camera right now.
That's great.
There we go. I don't know why it turned
on autofocus, y'all. What's up, y'all?
Hold on. One sec. Let me fix this camera
for y'all.
Turn off auto. Apply.
Okay, you guys can hear me, right?
What's up, y'all?
Thanks, Cameron.
Um, just so y'all know, when I put her
her um
when I unmute her mic on on the mixer
here, there may be a little bit of like
it's sounding like it's being hit, but
that's cuz she has to hold it. I
basically took it off of here and
brought it to her. Okay.
Um,
yeah, I haven't I I've never been
nervous to go live ever. So,
I apologize. And also, if I look like I
if I look like I've been through [ __ ]
and hell and all that, it's kind of cuz
I have. Um,
first of all,
before before I press on mute on her and
let her talk to y'all, I just wanted to
give you all a rundown kind of what
happened. Um, for those of you who have
clicked the GoFundMe, whether you
donated or not, it
first of all, the people who did Oh my
god. Um, we weren't expecting anything
like that. Um, I wouldn't even plan on
making one until you guys said to.
Um,
basically as y'all know from her last
live stream and recent events, she had
been going through a lot of
what you would call like normal health
issues.
Um, the iron deficiency, anemia making
her tired and dizzy, all that stuff. um
the
uh hypertension,
uh vitamin deficiencies, all that stuff,
right? Um
then we found out she was pregnant. Um
and then when she went to the OB
after that um
the sack hadn't grown any and no fetal
pole had attached to the gestational
sack um meaning basically she hadn't
miscarried in the eyes of that doctor.
So on October 1st, she had to have a DNC
surgery to remove the sack because of
her anemia because it's not safe for her
to try to pass it on her own because she
could could have had a bleeding issue.
Fast forward to October 6, this past
Monday. Um,
I woke up out of my sleep at about 6:00
a.m.
and I heard her moaning a little bit in
the bathroom. I don't know how it woke
me up cuz it was very faint.
Um, when I opened the door,
she wasn't responding to me. She was
like slurring some words and then
her her eyes just rolled back and she
was unresponsive.
Eyes open, unresponsive, but straight
back to her back of her head. I called
911 immediately.
When the EMTs got here, her blood
pressure was 70 over 30 at that point,
somewhere in that range, 70 over like
35. It was extremely low.
Um, they rushed her to the hospital,
said told me not to try to follow
because they're going to be running
every red light.
when I got to the hospital about 15
minutes later once I had calmed down a
bit cuz I was
scared to death. Um
I've never seen that many doctors in one
room. Um
they then told me
that she was bleeding internally. Her
blood pressure was down to 60 over 30.
They were they had already ordered blood
for a transfusion.
Um
they had ordered scans and all this
other stuff. And um
the head doctor for the hospital was
actually in the room with her along with
three
OB surgeons, OBGYn surgeons and another
surgeon and a bunch of nurses. Um,
she kept passing out, coming back,
passing out, coming back. And they're
calling upstairs to tell them, "Get the
O ready. Get the O ready." And um
so
mid blood transfusion, the OB surgeon
said, "I'm not waiting anymore.
Get her get her in the preop and up to
the O."
And so they rushed her up.
He told me to say, you know, hugs and
kisses and say your goodbyes
essentially. Um,
when she got upstairs,
I couldn't see her from then. So, for
the next 3 hours, I'm downstairs losing
my mind. Don't know what's going to
happen.
Um,
then I get a call from the head nurse
telling me that the doctor is going to
be coming down to talk to me. And all I
asked is, "Is she okay? Is she
breathing?" And the nurse said, "Yes,
the doctor's on the way down." So, at
that point, I at least was able to
breathe a little bit knowing
she she's made it. She made it through,
but I don't know what's going on. doctor
comes down,
explains to me how dangerously close
everything was, um,
and tells me that, you know, she
actually had an ectopic pregnancy,
meaning that
the fetus was growing in her fallopian
tube and she also had a m a very large
cyst and multiple smaller cysts on on
her ovary, all of which burst at the
same time. The cysts and the fallopian
tube burst in major blood vessels and
she bled um over 2 L worth of blood into
her abdomen.
Um
they were able to remove
the cyst. They just removed the ovary,
not the cyst, the the ovary. And they
removed that area of the fallopian tube
and were able to stop the bleeding. And
they told me that she would make it
through as long as she
was able to make it the next couple
nights in recovery.
Next couple nights really sucked, but
she made it through. Thank God. Um,
she did, if y'all saw the post the other
day, she did have to go back to the
hospital the other day, but it was it
ended up just being a side effect from
all the anesthesia and things she was on
and it she was fine. Her blood pressure
spiked a lot before she went, but that
had to do with her being scared and in
pain at the same time.
Um, I may be leaving out some details of
what happened that morning. Um, because
I just don't want to
relive every bit of it,
but basically she's going to be down for
a good bit. Um,
probably about eight weeks. Um they're
saying um her posttop followup is
tomorrow and I will update y'all
tomorrow
and let y'all know what's going on. And
I just want to let y'all know the amount
of support emotionally, financially
either way has been [ __ ] incredible.
And I don't think that
the days would have went by as as easy
cuz they weren't easy, but y'all made it
a lot easier. Um, the amount of love
y'all showed my my wife, I can't I can't
thank y'all enough.
So, with that being said, I'm going to
unmute her so y'all can talk to her.
And yeah, also Dio, thank you for the
super chat.
And I know I have a lot of y'all and a
lot of y'all have heard your thoughts
and I really appreciate it. I'm trying
to keep it together, you know.
>> I'm unmuting you over here. Jesus
Christ.
>> They can hear.
>> Can they y'all hear me over here? Just
so y'all know, I've have to taken some
medicine. So, I may not be like 100%
like I guess clearheaded or whatever,
but god damn, it's it's a it's a mental
thing more than a pain thing to me
because I just know what happened and
where I've been at and like really said,
I appreciate you guys.
Um, oh, Viper, I appreciate that. Thank
you for the super chat.
um a life experience that I never
thought I would experience. Um something
that replays in my mind a lot. The I
know I know. Yeah. Okay. I can't I can't
say it out loud yet cuz I'm don't think
I'm ready to say those words like Yeah.
You could it would have could have been.
So,
um I honestly don't even know really
what to say.
Um,
appreciate really I appreciate you got
me over here. Damn near about to lose my
[ __ ] I'm trying to hold it together as
well. But um I'm okay n Oh, here we go.
I can't laugh. I'm okay. I I'm okay,
guys. Like it's it's more like I said, I
am in pain. The pain sucks, but it's
more of a mental thing. a little
traumatizing. I think maybe I'm just not
like used to these this kind of not I
don't I really don't even know how to
put these words like I don't I don't
have right words for this but I do
appreciate everybody for helping and and
you know and and support Frosty. Oh my
god, thank you so much.
Um,
yeah. I'm And okay, I what I'm going to
try to do is not I don't know how to
deal with serious issues. So, I will be
very joky and I will try not to be very
jokey. I don't know how to deal with
situations like this. So, I'm I'm trying
not to be a goofball right now. You
>> said to show them your pimp cane.
>> Yeah. Oh, yeah. I do got a pimp cane,
y'all. I got a pimp cane. Oh, I can't
laugh. I do have a pimp cane. Yeah, I
get I get to walk a couple times a day.
Um, depending on how I'm feeling. I'm
scared tomorrow with this posttop
because I don't want this doctor to have
to go through and change stitch. I don't
know how this is going to go. I don't
know the whole process. They cut my
whole damn belly open. So, I don't I
don't really know. I'm I'm scared cuz I
I know the pain. The pain's going to
come back and I don't The pain was
horrendous, y'all. But that was the most
scariest thing. I because I like my
brain. Okay, I can just go ahead and say
it. [ __ ] it. I felt like dying. This
I've never experienced that in my life,
but feeling the feel of dying. Like I
could I thought I was talking to Rei,
but apparently I wasn't talking to Rei
and I was trying to just hold myself up.
It's the [ __ ] It's It's [ __ ]
crazy.
the it's really mentally [ __ ] That's
all that is. That is just mentally
[ __ ]
I I I really I don't think this is, you
know, we're we're here y'all just to
give y'all an update on things, but I
don't know if this is really a good idea
anymore. Okay, go ahead.
>> All right, I'm muting you,
>> guys. I I can't stay live. I have to go.
All right. I gotta make sure she's good
because she's it's not good right now.
Okay.
Just know that we love y'all and we
appreciate everything and
the only reason we went live was because
well I went live.
Go ahead. I just wanted to say thank you
you guys. I appreciate everybody. I'm
sorry.
Oh, this is embarrassing. Also, at the
same time, this is Oh my god. And mute
me.
>> I got you.
Also felt kind of like I needed to just
based on the amount of support
that y'all shown.
It's incredible. Um, I'm going to leave
this up for anybody that needs to that
doesn't know what's going on. And um
yeah,
I I can't keep talking about it either
right now.
Just know we love y'all and we love all
the support y'all give is incredible.
It's incredible.
But
I'll try to give y'all an update soon
and hopefully, you know,
have more dialogue as the days go on,
but this ain't easy right now.
It's just not.
And
it's okay in terms of she I'm confident
she'll be okay,
but it's a long road for her to get all
the way better. And on top of that, the
emotional side of it.
I don't know what else to say right now.
Um,
other than thank you to all of y'all.
I'm sorry I'm not keeping up with chat.
She's still reading your chats, by the
way. Um, but I can't I can't I I'm just
I'm going to end up just talking in
circles and [ __ ] my head up again.
So,
just know we love y'all. We appreciate
every single one of y'all.
And I'll talk to y'all later. Hopefully,
she will as well.
Well, she will as well.
Yeah. I'll talk to y'all later. All
right.
