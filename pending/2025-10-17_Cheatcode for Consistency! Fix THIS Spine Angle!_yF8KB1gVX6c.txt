All right, Sean, hit us another one.
>> All right.
>> So, what Sean is working on is we like
to call it the cheat code for
consistency. You want to explain what
what you're doing here that that we're
really focusing in on?
>> Yeah. So, in gears, there's a line that
comes up out of the body called the
virtual spine. So, we like to see,
especially I like to see from my back
swing and the people that come in and
work with us get fairly neutral at the
top of the swing with the virtual spine
that's coming out of the body as opposed
to being leaned excessively toward the
target or excessively away basically
around that 90° mark at the top of the
swing.
>> Okay. Now, what we want to share with
you guys today watching the video is
what it's going to look like on 3D
compared to what it's going to look like
from a face on camera that you're all
used to seeing when you film your
swings. So, you got two parts of the
spine that that control that angle, the
top and the bottom part.
>> Right. So, basically tailbone and top of
the neck.
>> Exactly. Right. Now, we teach
recentering, which is just basically
getting the pelvis right back to the
middle where it starts by the time you
get to the top of the swing. So that's
controlling the bottom part of the
spine. Okay? So right back in the
middle. So now we're focusing on the top
part of the spine. And if it's less than
90°, it means it's tilted towards the
target. That's a steepening movement for
the golf swing that most golfers do not
need.
>> Yeah. So, if you thought about
steepeners and shallower, if I'm leaning
excessively toward the target with the
upper part of my spine here
>> and I start down from there, that's a
steepening motion that's going to make
the hand path and the club want to
travel out over the target line.
>> Right? So, we want to avoid that. Yeah.
>> Right. I mean, and there's going to be a
couple degrees of leeway, right? We're
human, you know, we don't play on
perfectly flat surfaces. We're shooting
for that 90ish.
>> Yeah. And on the other side of the coin,
if I'm at the top and my spine is too
far away now, when I turn on that ball
and try to hit it, the club is way too
far from the inside and you you're to
hit blocks.
>> More of a hooker pattern. Exactly. Okay.
So, if we look at that last swing you
just made and we've got Sean here in the
Gears hybrid system. So, we can show you
the 3D there. So, Sean, you did exactly
what you were trying to do. You were
exactly 90 degrees that spine angle. So,
dead neutral. There's a lot of physical
benefits of being dead neutral at the
top. One, it's going to be safer for
your back. We both dealt with back
issues. Two, it's going to allow you to
rotate better. So, you're not really
biasing the spine one way or the other.
Now, you notice the green line here is
going to look different than Sean's
actual physical dimensions for size,
thickness, and all that. So if we start
to fade the gears image out, you'll see
what a 90 degree spine looks like
actually in practice. So if you make to
the top of your swing, Sean. So if you
just think his shirt tag down his
backline, you want to see some angle
away from the target to produce a 90°
spine angle. Cuz on video, you can't see
through the body and see the spine angle
like we can on 3D. But that's how you're
going to equate it to what you're
looking at on 2D is to see that spine
angle tilted away. Now, we're gonna have
Sean hit another one here in a second
where that spine angle, this is what a
lot of golfers tell us they're trying to
do is they're trying to get that back
line vertical or even leaning towards
the target thinking that makes the spine
neutral and it you'll see in a second it
doesn't.
>> Yeah. So that the thought process and
we've had people come through here
lately that are trying to make a back
swing where if they drew a line down
from their left shoulder almost trying
to stay on that line the entire back
swing. So I'll hit one
>> that's going to produce that steep pivot
pattern that reverse spine angle
>> that we do not want to do because it's
very steep bias. Now before you hit that
let's talk about what you're pivoting
around
>> if I do it correctly. Yes.
>> Yeah. So, the way we like to to teach it
and think about it, and we've had a lot
of luck helping people like this. If I
had a tennis ball buried inside kind of
my upper rib cage, right between my
front and back and left to right this
way on my rib like through the
shoulders, which you can see here on
gears, that spot right dead between.
>> Yeah. So, it's buried in there. Now,
>> if I was to stand tall and just turn,
that ball is going to kind of rotate
level. Right now, I'm bent over x number
of degrees. I'm just trying to turn that
tennis ball right around itself without
pitching it one way or the other. So,
it's just a pivoting motion like this
where that ball is just spinning around
like a like a globe in your house or
something. You can visualize that if you
pitch that globe on an angle. I'm just
turning around that spot of my body. And
if I do that, that puts me in that
position at the top that we're talking
about. Gives me that fairly neutral
vertical spine. Yeah.
>> Virtual spine.
>> You can imagine the plane of that,
right? So, we'll say this side of my
phone is Sean's right shoulder. This is
left shoulder. And this middle is that
spine you're talking about with the
tennis ball. Again, level turn. Nobody
thinks the shoulder should go down. Now,
when the golfer is tilted, so many of
you are trying to tilt that left
shoulder down, which is what we want to
avoid. We just want to turn around that
same plane. The shoulder will move down
some, but over quite a bit more. if you
perfectly turn around that center and
don't let it sway one way or the other.
So, it's not a lead shoulder down, left
side down at all to make it work
correctly. It's just a little bit of
down and that down happens because
you're tilted and you're turning.
>> Now, let's show the part that we want to
avoid. Yeah.
>> So, you're going to try to get your back
line on video now vertical or even
slightly tilted forward.
>> Exactly. So, imagine I had the line
straight down, plumb bob, from the
outside of my left shoulder at a dress.
And then, you know, if you've been
taught to, you know, left shoulder down
and kind of keep your back against that
line,
>> you'll end up getting something like one
second.
>> Something like this.
>> Okay.
>> All right. Let me rehearse that a couple
of times.
>> Okay. What What do you suspect you'll
see there for a spining?
>> Maybe 80.
>> Okay.
>> Maybe more. I can't do it a lot because
I have a bad back.
>> Case in point, right?
>> Yeah. It it starts to bother my lower
back. I go over past 80.
>> 79.
>> Okay.
>> Okay. Not anywhere
close to the most tilt we've ever seen.
>> No. Seen.
>> We've We've seen 69°.
>> I think what I did there to make it not
as exaggerated, I kind of spun my hips.
Most of the guys that tilt left will go
like this a little bit more. So, let's
do one more just so I can
>> Okay.
>> show how that would look because there's
probably two versions of this that
you'll see
>> in your own swing.
>> On this one, you're going to kick the
pelvis to the side. So, the the bottom
of the pelvis is going to shift, top of
the pelvis is going to shift forward.
And this is the combination we see every
week from golfers trying to keep a
neutral spine.
>> Exactly. Right. So,
>> we'll give it a shot.
>> You ready?
>> You're ready?
>> All right. Here we go.
It's a real steep pattern.
Yeah, you've really got to, it's a great
point. You've really got to unsteepen it
by throwing the spine in reverse. This
is where back issues really become a
problem.
>> That time I just kind of let the club
crash into the ground. Was it an angle
of attack?
>> You didn't You didn't want to risk the
back on that
>> angle of attack got a little steep
there.
>> Okay. 74. The most we've seen here is
69° of tilt.
>> It's a back breaker
>> from a golfer who thought he was turning
around a neutral spine.
>> Yeah. Now, if we look a little deeper to
that, this goes back to that point of
the center of the shoulders. Okay? Where
is that ball moving? Is it moving
forward or is it staying put and you're
just pivoting around it? Which is what
we want to be doing. If we look at the
center of the shoulders, you shifted
that ball three and a half inches
forward at the top of your swing. That's
again golfers trying to get their
shoulders steep, trying to get the left
shoulder down, point the shoulders at
the ball. All of that will produce this
reverse spine tilt which is a killer for
consistency. To keep the consistency,
the cheat code for consistency is to
control the spine angle.
>> Yeah. And controlling the the motion of
the the shoulders and the rib cage. You
got to remember everything in golf has
its own plane, right?
>> Everyone just thinks of swing plane with
the golf club, but you know, if if I'm
like this, this shoulder motion has its
own plane. like this this dot. If I had
a dot on my shoulder, I don't anymore.
The gear is hybrid, but if I had a
little dot right here, that has its own
trajectory. The left one has its own. I
don't want to make a swing where I dive
the shoulder down or even excessively
flatten it. I'm just put putting the
shoulders on this plane that I kind of
established when I set up to the ball
and keep it super simple and you'll have
a neutral spine.
>> Now, looking at the video of your last
swing, your back line is vertical.
Again, this is what we see golfers doing
every week. And that was actually
tilting your spine 16 degrees towards a
target. So with 3D, it's like no, it's
very clear to see. But in video, there's
just unless you see 3D, often you think,
"Oh, maybe that looks pretty good."
>> Well, you could say, "Oh, look, it's
straight up and down on the backline.
That's a super neutral great pivot." But
when you really dig in in 3D, that's not
what we're trying to do.
>> So, how to correct this? We'll imagine
our camera here is the mirror or your
phone at home.
>> Yep.
>> Make back swings with a little bit of
angle to your spine without your head
drifting to the right, to the left.
Again, there's a little bit of margin
for error there, but you don't want big
movements. You just want to turn around
that tennis ball.
>> Yeah. And if you put your club like
this, you're thinking about taking it
kind of across, right? because it starts
where it starts and it moves across
without a big or any real translation or
movement of your rib cage away. You've
got yourself a beautiful pivot. And you
can see I just had that little bit of
away. Sets me up to unwind, stay on top
of the ball, and hit a good shot.
>> It's all you got to do. So, if you want
a cheat code for consistency, you're not
hitting it as solid as you think you
should be. Look at what your spine's
doing first and foremost. And this is
real simple to
