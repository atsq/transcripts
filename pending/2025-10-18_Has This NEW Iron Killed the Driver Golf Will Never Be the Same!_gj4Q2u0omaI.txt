Oh,
>> he's joking me.
>> No,
>> that's a great shot.
>> I get driver like distance from my
utility iron. I use it more than driver
and I hit it way straighter. And you
know what? Sometimes I think I have to
agree with John. For some golfers, a
utility iron out on the golf course is
genuinely a lifesaver. It allows golfers
who hate driver to have huge amounts of
distance and you know what not feel like
they're having to hit like a fire. So I
do get it. But it's also a great club if
you're smashing into wind. And we have
this here the second stroke index 15
here at Junes in Portugal. And we're
going to do this challenge. Right. We've
got driver versus utility iron. So,
we're going to start from the T and we
are going to see if this new Apex
Callaway UT IO actually has driver like
distance cuz I get it right into wind.
This is where you're like, okay, well,
it's going to have driver like distance,
but I'm really interested to see. So,
it's super simple. We're going to hit
two drives with my driver and we're
going to hit two drives with the brand
new Callaway utility iron. Let's see
what ball speeds. Let's see what
distances we get. And actually, let's
see what they perform like down the
fairway. Plus, we're going to have bags
of data. And from there, we're going to
hit two shots into the green because I
believe a utility iron can't just be
good and be used from the tea. It also
has to be good into the green. And to
make this video 10 times better, Josh is
back on the channel and he's going to be
down the fairway letting us know which
one's longer, which ones hit the
fairway. And Josh, come on. Give us the
point system for this video.
>> So, anything in the fairway will get a
point.
>> Yeah. Anything off the fairway that I
deem a good miss was half a point.
>> He's a good miss. Half a point. He's a
tough customer as well. Like it's going
to be a tough ask this.
>> One thing I'll say is if you miss this
fairways,
>> it's wide.
>> We have a problem.
>> It's been known. It's been known. So
nice and simple. If this club right
here, we're going to hit four shots
overall. If we get three out of four,
that would put this club at a gold
standard. Okay? And if we get then two
out of four shots, that would put it at
a silver. And then if we only get one,
that would put it at a bronze. Now,
we're also going to factor into this how
much shorter this is than the driver.
Okay, we're going to factor that in
because I think that's really important
into wind. How does this perform? So,
it's going to have four shots with this
tub with driver. And I'm interested to
see how it performs from the T and also
the fairway. Poor precision, forward
control, the distance you need when you
need it most. My first opinion is that
this thing is an absolute work of art
and it it's quite interesting to see
this top line. I'm really interested to
see what that tech actually is there. I
guess it looks a little different to the
previous model in this range. It looks
like it's going to be hot. Let's get
Josh on the phone here. I'm just giving
him a quick call. It's also important
we're going to have all the data on this
machine right here. I'm just saying,
mate. Uh, I'm sorry. I've given you a
quick call and I'm gonna get all the
data so we can review this in terms of
like what it's different to a driver um
and how it's actually obviously
performing in real life. It' be cool to
know.
>> Right. Okay.
>> Here we go. UT Iron. This thing looks
like an absolute beast. We're going to
start off. Josh, it's the UT Iron coming
up first.
That is absolutely smoked. That's
straight at you.
>> Please tell me you have that online.
>> Oh my. No.
That's a great shot.
>> How close was that to you?
>> Oh, no. I'm fine.
>> No, I'm fine.
>> Are you fine?
>> Well, I mean, I was actually really
worried then for a second. Okay, that
was hit really good. So, how far
>> one point you have maybe got you're
hitting a wedge in 100%. That's a great
shot.
>> Interesting.
>> Right, here we go. We'll know more once
I hit this driver. Right, here we go.
Driver, this is going to come out low,
mate. I'm actually going to hit this as
if we're hitting into the wind. Well,
that's cuz we are hanging into the wind.
But this is the point of this video.
Does this give us driverl like distance
when we need it most? That felt really
good. Like that is pure feeling off the
face.
So that's a point for that club. Here's
driver.
That is smoked, mate. You're moving
straight onto that.
>> That was smoked.
>> It was smoked. And it's too big in the
bunker.
>> Oh, that was it. So good. That was it. I
don't think I've got a better into the
wind driver.
>> That was a great shot.
>> Oh my. Right. I mean, right now this is
it's it's I feel like Josh, I'm going to
be giving John a call and been saying,
mate, like this is not even in the same
realm, but we do need to hit more shots.
Roughly, how much difference in distance
do you think that was there?
>> That was there
>> um finished maybe maybe 15 yards. 15
yards difference.
>> 15 yards difference. Yeah.
>> Okay. But but the driver is in the
bunker down here. In fact, I just paced
out from the front of the bunker. 17
yards exactly.
>> 17 yards from where the where the and
and it went in there pretty quick.
Right.
>> Right.
>> It did. It did.
>> Okay. Okay. Right. Okay. I got to hit
one more with each mate.
>> Perfect.
>> Like I saying, I think like I'm going to
have to Well, John, I get it. For some
people that a utility iron gives them
way more confidence than a driver. 17
yards. Are we saying that's getting a
point?
>> Oh, 100% getting a point, mate.
>> Okay, perfect. That's given a point.
Okay, Josh is a judge. That's giving it
a point. Okay, here we go. We're going
to stick with the driver and then into
the utility. Here's driver number two.
>> Oh, it's a little leaky.
Stand on the fairway. Is that okay?
>> Yeah. Found fairway. And that has gone
maybe a yard further than the first
utility iron.
>> Wow. Interesting.
Only a yard further.
>> Yeah, not much difference at all. Pacing
it. Pacing it. Three yards. But you get
my drift. There's not much difference
there.
>> Now remember, on every single one of
these shots, I am getting the data on
our device right here. So, we can see
how the data and the ball speeds
actually match up to what actually
happens in real life. Because we buy
clubs to see what happened in real life.
We don't just always buy it because
that's the data inside. I think that's a
really important point. I think there's
a really really important point to think
about here. Okay, here's the final shot
coming up with this UTI. I've only hit
one so far. I'm dying to know what this
feels like when I'm not hitting it off
the tea and which we're going to explore
that after hitting this final shot here
from the tea. I'll be honest with you,
mate. I didn't quite get that driver.
>> Yeah.
>> Um but at least I'm on the fairway.
Okay, here we go.
>> Yeah, here we go.
>> I didn't get that anywhere near as good.
No, it is it is considerably shorter
than the first. Still found the fairway.
Not a bad shot. Still gets a point for
the fairway, but you are you are
considerably shorter than the first one.
>> Okay, so that mis hit. Okay, this is
something we need to think about. Uh,
okay, come back here, mate. If you can
get us, I got something to ask in the
buggy. So, Josh, before I go through
some of that data, and it's seriously
weird to come down here and see like
that hole from this perspective. So,
they've got near this bunker right here.
I want to just go through a bit of the
tech within this because I think it
looks like an absolute gem this club.
Like it looks mean. Like I think it's
definitely in that market for somebody
that's a mid to low handicapper that
doesn't get on with driver cuz I've seen
chunkier before in my life.
>> It is a good looking golf club though.
>> Very good looking.
>> I could I feel like I could play 100%.
>> Moving on to tech.
>> First thing that I find really
interesting in the utility iron is that
it's got a multi-material forge
construction. So Callaway have got their
famous urethane microsphere which
basically dampens the vibrations up and
makes it feel softer and more responsive
through impact. Yeah, I think I agree.
It felt quite soft and feeling through
impact. It did feel buttery smooth
>> with the second one that you didn't hit
quite as well. Could you feel that more
in your hands?
>> It's a great point. It's a great point.
I forgot I hit a bad one. I tried to
erase my memory.
>> Sorry.
>> Why did you bring it up?
>> I didn't say bad. I said didn't hit
quite as well. Uh being honest, yeah, I
did feel it a little bit and it was
considerably shorter.
>> Yes, it was.
>> It was considerably shorter.
>> Now, that brings me on to the data. Um
because I think this is really really
interesting. So, if I bring the data up
here, Josh, that is the grouping of the
drivers and the irons of the tea.
>> It's not too bad, is it?
>> And that's what you saw on the right.
>> Absolutely.
>> That is the carry distances. 203 with
the driver, 185 with the irons. That's
the ball speed. 153.8 with the Callaway
driver. 136. But for not that much game
because of the conditions. Because of
the conditions. Like I'll be honest,
when I get into windy conditions, I'm
more likely to go with a utility iron
than a driver. I feel I can keep it
straighter. And I do get overall why
people do that.
>> And I think if you take that hole, that
exact hole.
>> Yeah.
>> It was what playing maybe three the the
hole itself was maybe what 320 from
where you were. Um, it's the perfect
club.
>> You're into wind. You're taking out the
risk of going in the bunker and you're
just you have more control. It's about
all about control.
>> Agree. And look at the difference in
dispersion. Callaway UT 182,89 the good
and the bad. Whereas the driver, we had
198 on my bad and 209. So, a bigger
dispersion. Only a little bit, but a
bigger dispersion. You giving me this
hole?
>> I think this hole's good. I think from
here is is Well, we may need to go a bit
closer.
>> Yeah, need to go a little bit closer.
You're joking me.
>> I rate you, mate.
And I really love the design of this,
how it has got like sort of this almost
bolted on area at the back. Now, what's
really interesting now is we're about to
test this off the fairway. And the
Callaway are saying that they have a
dynamic new sole design. That's this bit
here. And and if I summarize that,
they're saying that it gives you more
consistent strikes with off the tea or
the fairway. It gives you better trail
and leading edge which helps the club
exit easier through that turf. I'm in
love with this bolt-on bit. I really
really am. I get Edm what I said earlier
this is not for the faint-hearted though
this club on that point. Does anybody
actually have a utility Josh he's
actually checked what we finished on
with points there. Let's give him a
bell. So he's just gone up to the green
now. We're holding this club to very
very high standards and we're now going
to see what it's like from the fairway
because it wants to be a club. If you're
thinking of adding it, that is not
replacing your driver and it's replacing
something like a a hybrid, then it needs
to land soft, too. Okay. Are we are we
saying this club has two points?
>> Uh, yes. Yeah. Both in the middle of the
fairway, both get a point 100%.
>> And and anything because it was so close
to driver, are we going two and a half?
Another half point. I'm not asking. I'm
begging for points here, by the way.
>> You know what? I I I was thinking the
first one because of the position that
it was in on the fairway, I was going to
give it an extra an extra half point.
So, I'm glad you reminded me of that. So
that puts us 2 and 1/2 points.
>> Okay. Two and a half points out of four.
>> We're already in bronze. Two is in
bronze.
>> We just need another half point and it's
got in silver.
>> Yeah. And then if we get if we get the
four then happy days for this club.
>> Okay. Right. I'm interested to see how
this lands. And as we look at this club
down at the ball, that's the view from
the top. I wouldn't say it has a really
thin top line, but it's certainly not
the thickest. It looks beautiful,
though. There's a little bit more offset
than I would imagined. for new golfers.
That's this little bit in here where the
club juts back slightly. I can't stand
here and turn around and say it's
confidence inspiring, but it's certainly
not too scary. Let us know. Actually,
like John said earlier, would you say
it's fair to say anybody that's watching
this video right now, let us know if
they um essentially use one of these
clubs as instead of their driver into
wind.
>> Yeah. And let us know what the club is
as well.
>> Right, mate. Keep your eyes on this,
please.
>> Ah, it's right.
It's right.
>> That's okay. That's okay. That's getting
half a point. That That's getting half a
point. That is pin high in a good place
to miss. You are just chipping across
the green to the flag. That's a good
miss.
>> Okay. Okay. Fair. Fair. Josh, give me
half a point there. I didn't hit it
great at all, which is quite interesting
how it's got back there. These are such
testing conditions.
This is ripped. This is straight at your
head.
>> This is moving on to the flag. Be the
club, please.
>> Oh,
>> you are joking me. That was such a good
shot.
>> That just got caught up in the wind.
>> I couldn't hit a better shot, mate. I
don't have a better one in my locker.
>> I
honestly I'm going to say another half
because it's again, it's not a bad miss.
You've still got a bit of space and
Yeah, another half point for me.
>> So, that's three and a half points in
total. Yes.
>> Yeah.
>> Silver.
>> Good. Good. Good math, mate. Good maths.
>> Yeah.
>> How close was that?
>> That was absolutely ripped. I did feel
that word beautifully through that turf.
Like, did I feel it worked any
differently than any other two iron that
I'd hit before? No. But it felt bloody
lovely. If you look at it there, I
almost want to take this off and and
take and see what's underneath there.
That's really really cool. Really cool.
And as you would expect with all the
models in the Callaway Apex range, it
does come with a forged face. Also, it's
a silver rating. Overall, I think it's
mightily impressive into win. And I'm
going to agree with John. I can see why
people would have a utility iron over a
driver. One, if you're struggling with
driver overall and you just love the
look of an iron down at the ball, would
this be the one? If you're struggling
with driver, probably not because it's
so thin. But I would say this, if you're
a mid to low handicap golfer, this thing
is a gem. It really does perform. It's
great from the tea, as you saw,
seriously competitive with distance and
from the fairway. Look, these are hard
off the deck, right? You can't argue.
They're hard overall, but I think a
seriously good performing club. We
didn't hit the green with either of
them, but they certainly the bad shot I
hit to the right was okay. And Josh Ray
Kylin gave me two half points with them
both. So, thank you, sir. Overall,
opinion on this club for you?
>> I think it's great. I think the reason
why I gave the two half points is
because as a club golfer, I'm happy with
where they finish.
>> It gives me a chance. Do you know what I
mean? It gives me a chance from there.
It's a hard cup hit like you say. I
think it looks fantastic.
>> I would have been harsh. I would have
given myself any points, but you're the
one that's the adjudicator on here. So,
I appreciate it.
>> I'm just giving it from my perspective.
You might give yourself that higher
wanting to hit the green, but for me,
two decent misses.
>> I'm always very harsh myself, but like
you are. We're all golfers, right?
