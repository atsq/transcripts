It's no secret that I love hanging. So
much so that my longest hang was 23
minutes and 22 seconds. Yep, that's me
hanging on for dear life. Now, the good
news is you don't have to hang anywhere
close to that in order to get the
benefits that I'm going to talk about in
this video. In fact, latest research has
shown that only 1 to 2 minutes is plenty
of hanging time if you do it regularly.
And to be honest, I didn't even train
for more than two or three minutes at a
time before I undertook this challenge.
When I first started hanging, I did not
think that it would do so much for my
health. It just felt too simple. But
after I tried it for 30 days straight,
my body felt completely different. It
was like medicine. The benefits that I
was getting to me seemed like magic. So,
if you sit a lot, if your shoulders are
stiff, tight, and immobile, if your
upper back aches, or you feel compressed
and hunched over, this might be the
simplest fix that you have never tried.
Here's the problem. We as humans were
built to hang. But we stopped. Just look
at kids on monkey bars. Look at apes in
trees. We have the anatomy for it. Long
arms, strong shoulders, mobile scapula,
a nice grippy thumb. Hanging is in our
evolutionary blueprint. But what do most
adults do now? We sit, we type, we
scroll, we hunch, and we barely reach
overhead in daily life. So what happens
when we stop hanging? Compression in the
spine. Gravity pulls us down. And
without decompression, the spine
tightens and shortens. We suffer from
poor posture, forward head, rounded
shoulders, collapsed rib cage. We get
reduced shoulder range. So we lose the
overhead capacity that makes us human
and we experience chronic tightness and
pain especially in the neck traps lats
and rotator cuff. Dead hangs undo all of
that. So what do dead hangs actually do
to your body? This movement might look
passive but it's creating huge internal
change. The first is shoulder
decompression. Dead hangs literally pull
space into the shoulder joint. This
reduces impingement, improves range of
motion, and it can prevent injuries.
Second thing is spinal lengthening.
Think of it like traction. It gently
stretches and decompresses the spine. It
is great for people with back stiffness,
especially after sitting or training.
Number three, it resets the posture. It
reverses that tech neck and rounded
shoulders. It re-engages your upper
back, scapula, and rib cage to open the
front of the body. Number four, grip
strength. One of the first things to
improve and research shows that grip
strength is one of the strongest
predictors of longevity. More on that in
a moment. Number five, it regulates the
nervous system. Hanging activates
stretch receptors and the
parasympathetic nervous system. You
literally calm down while decompressing.
It's sort of like pressing a reset
button for your entire upper body. So,
how do you hang properly, even if you're
a beginner? And don't worry, this isn't
just for gymnasts or crossfitters. So,
you can use anything to hang a sturdy
pull-up bar, a doorway bar, gym rings,
or even a strong tree branch. You can
even hang a towel over a tree. In a
hang, you want to relax your shoulders.
Let the scapula rise. Let the body
lengthen. You can also practice active
hangs where you engage your lats and
shoulders slightly, keeping control.
This is better for beginners and
shoulder rehab. So, how long should you
hang? Well, you can start with 10 to 20
seconds at a time. Aim to accumulate 1
to 2 minutes each day in sets or small
chunks. Build slowly. It's not about
ego, it's about consistency. The more
you do it, the better it is. Over time,
I would like you to achieve 5 minutes of
accumulated daily hanging. Some
modifications that beginners can use.
You can keep your toes lightly on the
ground for support. You can use a bench
behind you for even more support or a
lower bar to reduce the intensity.
Breathe deeply, relax the jaw and the
face and focus on control, not force.
So, what can you expect if you try this
for 30 days? Well, here is how it
changed my body over the course of 4
weeks. Week one, my forearms were toast.
My shoulders achd. My grip gave out
fast. Honestly, I questioned if it was
even worth it, but I kept at it. And by
week two, suddenly my upper back opened
up. I caught myself standing taller,
breathing deeper. Pain in my neck from
computer work started to fade. The hang
felt less intimidating, and I could
actually feel things popping in my spine
as it decompressed the joints. It was
wild. And on to week three, that's when
my grip started holding longer without
even trying. I remember thinking, "What
is going on here?" I felt so beast mode,
like I was training for some strongman
event. I also noticed more control in
overhead pressing and pulling movements,
and my shoulders felt more set in place
and stable. My long-standing frozen
shoulder injury was beginning to show
signs of improvement. It was actually
amazing. And when I got into week four,
it became like a craving. I would look
forward to it first thing in the
morning, last thing at night. I warmed
up with it before training and I cooled
down with it after. I crave it in
between sets, during daily breaks, or
when I felt tight. And the weirdest
part, my mind felt calmer, my breath
slower. It became almost meditative.
Honestly, it's become my favorite thing
to do. By day 30, your body starts
adapting around this movement. Your
posture changes, your joints open, and
your nervous system treats it like a
daily reset button. And there's a little
insight on grip strength and longevity.
Here's where it gets interesting.
Multiple studies have shown that grip
strength is directly correlated with
life expectancy. In fact, in older
adults, lower grip strength has been
linked to higher risk of heart disease,
increased risk of falls and fractures,
greater likelihood of hospitalization,
shortened lifespan. A 2015 study in the
Lancet concluded that grip strength is a
strong predictor of all cause mortality,
even more so than systolic blood
pressure. So, if there is one thing that
you could do today to start reversing
aging, hanging might be it. So, how do
you stay consistent with this hanging?
Let's be honest, doing this everyday
sounds easy, but life does get in the
way. So, here's how I made it stick. I
would stack it with habit. So, hanging
while your coffee brews, while you're
reading, while you're scrolling the
internet, hanging before and during
workout. Just find somewhere that you
can grab and hang from. And most
importantly, track it. So, use your
notes app or a habit tracker. Start a
30-day challenge with a friend. Aim to
beat your weekly total, not just hold
for max. And just make it fun. Use a
timer with music. Hang barefoot outside.
Turn it into a morning ritual. If it
takes less than 2 minutes and makes your
whole body feel better, why wouldn't you
just try it? If you've been struggling
with stiffness, poor posture, or just
want to feel better in your body, start
here. Start hanging. It's primal. It's
powerful. and it might just be the
simplest longevity tool that you're not
using. And if you want more, click here
