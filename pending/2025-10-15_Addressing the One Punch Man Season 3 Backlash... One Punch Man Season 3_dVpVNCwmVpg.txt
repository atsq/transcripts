After the release of One Punch Man
season 3 episode 1, the internet has, as
usual, exploded with opinions. Some are
fair criticisms, others are pretty
passionate debates, but unfortunately,
there's also a side that literally just
crosses the line completely. Now, I'm
all for it when people express their
thoughts. That's what being part of a
fandom is. Like, that's the whole point
of joining a community. You share what
you love. And yes, sometimes being
disappointed when something doesn't meet
your expectations becomes one of it. But
when I came across some comments on my
literal YouTube video, it really made me
think about how we treat the people who
actually make these shows possible. And
I want to start with this one comment in
particular. So this is the comment that
I personally saw and just is a
jaw-dropping one. And I don't even want
to read it because I don't even want to
explain how wrong this is. This is not
even criticism. It's racism and it's
disgusting. You can dislike how the
episode was handled. You can talk about
pacing, the storyboarding or even the
animation quality. You can say, "Oh, the
animation is bad or whatever, whatever,
whatever." But the moment you bring
someone's race, nationality, or
background into your argument, you've
already failed to make a point.
Criticism should never be directed at
identity. It should be directed at the
work itself. Behind this episode are
artists who stayed up late, people who
sacrificed sleep and time just to
deliver something for the fans. even if
the end product didn't meet expectation
that doesn't give anyone the right to
throw racial slurs at the stuff. This
kind of comment doesn't just disrespect
the show as a whole. It literally
disrespect the medium of animation. And
it's just disgusting to see this type of
comments being thrown out casually just
because the episode doesn't reach your
expectation. Then there's another one I
saw that say, "True One Punch Man fans
are not letting this horrible animation
slide. The ones defending that horrible
episode are tourists. All right. Now,
tourists in anime, as far as I know,
basically means someone who just hopping
on the trend or basically people who
join the community pretty late just for
the sake of the hype and all that.
Basically, they are FOMO or something
like that. But to be honest, that logic
in this context doesn't even make sense
because everyone who actually watched
the episode with their eyes open,
whether they love it or not, can
definitely see that there were problems.
There were actual issues with the
episode itself. Most fans did point out
the lack of motion, the uneven
composition because of literally a
onetoone to the manga and also even the
rough direction choices. But again, just
because we also mention the good parts
that we like from the episode itself,
like how good the drawing quality is,
the OSD placement, the tone of it, the
compositing, that doesn't mean we're
defending the flaws. Acknowledging both
sides isn't quote unquote copium or
defending. It's called being fair. You
can respect the animator's effort and
still criticize the final product. That
is what in my personal opinion being a
fan truly means. Not just blindly hate
on the show itself and at the same time
not just blindly praise the show because
I agree the episode itself is not
perfect. It has tons of flaws. It has
its own issue. But again, but again
personally I see both sides of the
episode itself because at the end of the
day this series deserves to be talked
about with respect. Not true hate, not
true ignorance, and definitely not true
racism. And the more I think about it,
the more I realize this whole situation
with One Punch Man season 3 isn't just
about one episode alone. Because in the
later day when the rest of the season is
getting released, expectations will be
there. And ever since season 1 dropped,
One Punch Man becomes more than just a
popular anime. It became a benchmark for
animation quality. That dream team that
was assembled to make season 1 of One
Punch Man feels like a fever dream. It
set the bar so ridiculously high that
even if future seasons were handled by a
good studio, it would still be compared
to that once in a generation level of
production. But here's the reality. The
production cycles, the scheduling, the
deadlines, they are all brutal.
Sometimes even the most talented stuff
can't reach that same visual height. Not
because they don't care or they are
lazy. It's because of the production
constraint that just happened to face
One Punch Man. The problem comes when
fans forget that. We start to treat the
people behind the scene as machines. As
if a single drop in quality means they
are not trying or they are lazy. People
also forget that behind those frames are
people who went through hell just to
make it exist in the first place. Again,
it's okay to want great animation. I
mean, we all do. I do. But it's also
important to understand why things turn
out the way they do. The tragedy is when
criticism turns into hate. When the
conversation stop being about what went
wrong creatively and becomes about who
to attack personally. That's when the
whole meaning of giving a constructive
criticism just vanish. We were supposed
to support what we love, not tear down
the people making it. again supporting
in a way that is not blindly hating and
also not blindly praising them. So if
there's one thing I want you guys to
take away from all of this, it's that
patient that doesn't have to equal
aggression. You can demand batcher
without dehumanizing the people creating
the thing you love. And there's also
tons of comments comparing One Punch Man
season 3 to other show saying like even
this random slice of life romance anime
looks better than One Punch Man. And
while yes, some of those show do have
cleaner animation or overall betterl
looking anime, the difference here is
literally the word priority. So people
need to realize that high profile from a
popularity point of view and high
profile from a production point of view
are two very different things. The
industry doesn't always revolve around
popularity. From a studio perspective,
maybe the site of Clover Works that
handled My Dress Up Darling literally, I
mean like from the looks of it, they
have put a higher priority on my dress
up darling compared to Seash Bro. You
can see the difference in quality right
there. And you can see which one has the
higher priority in terms of production
importance. And yes, both My Dress of
Darling and Sean Dutyro are both made
under the same studio, which is Clever
Works. But here's the thing, they don't
share the same team. Every anime within
studio operates within different staff
groups, different producers, different
schedules, and even different budgets.
Think of it like a separate mini studios
under the same roof. For instance,
Minders of Darling was led by case
Shinoara, who has a history of working
with high-profile character animators
and color designers. Meanwhile, Seinro
though also handled by Clever Works, had
a completely different director,
producer, and animation lineup. So, even
though both anime came from the same
company, their quality differ based on
the internal teams assigned to each. But
before anyone takes this the wrong way,
I'm not saying one director or producer
or team is better than the other. Anime
production isn't a competition between
staff members, but it's mostly about
resources, scheduling, and what the
production committee expects from each
show. In this case, Microsoft Darling
simply had a much higher production
priority compared to Sutaro. That
basically means it had a more generous
timelines, stronger budget allocation
and a team assembled for its whole
aesthetic goals. So again, anime under
different production pipeline and also
under different production comedy often
gets a certain treatment to their own
production. And as for this case, we got
my dress of darling which had a much
more priority I would say compared to
Sean Byro in this case and which why my
dress of darling moves more or moves a
lot better than Sean Byro. But that
doesn't mean the anime is bad
whatsoever. I love my son by the way and
also Martin. So yeah. Meanwhile, One
Punch Man season 3 on JC stuff. The
situation is way messier. late
resources, tight scheduling, and also
the adaptation that is fighting for its
own legacy. We literally didn't have a
season for 6 years. While it is true,
everyone's your favorite IP to look
good, and honestly, it deserves to look
good. But your favorite manga being
popular doesn't mean it's automatically
going to attract the best animators in
the business. The top animators,
directors, and studios don't just jump
to the most famous series. They go where
they can create, where they can actually
experiment with a stable production and
schedule that gives them room to
breathe. Either that or they just have a
really strong connection with the
industry-leading talent. So to sum it up
in a nutshell, just because your show is
mainstream or your manga or your series
is mainstream doesn't mean it can
automatically pull all of the
industrially talent to work on it if
again it doesn't go align with what
their vision is. But of course, that
doesn't excuse poor management. And it's
okay to criticize the people in charge.
It's okay to want more for this series.
We all do. Even I personally want to see
One Punch Man moves differently. But at
the same time, we just need to
understand that there's a big difference
between a production not trying a
production not having the means to try.
And obviously people are just going to
go, "Well, it's definitely the studio
fault for accepting One Punch Man. It's
JC stuff problem." Well, personally, I
don't think it's actually them being the
villain here since the real issue
actually came from the higher up, the
production committee. If I need to pull
up a name, Bandai Namco. Well, Bandai is
definitely part of the production
committee. So one of those side in the
actual higher up of the production
committee are the one who decides the
budget, the time frame, the schedule and
that's basically sets the tone for
everything else. When you're handed a
bad schedule, you're already doomed
before you start. You can't animate
something properly if you are constantly
fighting the clock. You can't bring in
top talent if the schedule looks like a
train wreck. And no animators want to
work on a project that's going to burn
them out. Hell, even Vincent Chansard
said he doesn't even want to work with
Mapa after the hellish production that
he faced through in Jiujutsu Kaisen
season 2 episode 17. Well, at the end of
the day, the final product looks good.
Am I right? Yes. But people never
actually care the people who work behind
the scene. Whether they are burned out
or not, it's not even your problem. Am I
right? And yes, everyone, that's exactly
what's happening here. The schedule is
abysmal and is forcing even skilled
animators like Auto Key to rush through
their work or reuse certain shots just
to meet the deadlines. At the same time,
that doesn't mean One Punch Man season 3
won't have highlights. It will. There's
still a good amount of talent involved.
And when those moments actually hit, you
will definitely notice it. But when
people blame Jay-Z stuff, the studio, or
the individual artist, or even the
director, they are missing the bigger
picture. The problem isn't just in the
drawings. It's in the system that
doesn't give these creators the time or
resources to bring their best. At the
end of the day, One Punch Man season 3's
episode 1 isn't the strongest start. But
again, it's not the worst thing ever
either. It is a built-up episode. While
that's understandable given the part of
the story that it's adapting, I don't
think that alone should excuse how it
was handled. Still, I don't think it's
fair to throw all of this to the
animators or the stuff. They're doing
what they can within the time and
condition they've been given. And as
frustrating as it is, this is the
reality for a lot of anime today. What I
do hope is that as the season goes on,
the team hopefully can continuously gets
its own flow so that the adaptation
becomes more and more confident and more
and more convincing so that we start
seeing those flashes of brilliance that
remind us why people fell in love with
One Punch Man in the first place. So as
everyone, those are basically it. It's
just me yapping around again. But I hope
this video actually gave you some
thoughts and gave you some enlightenment
on the actual reality of One Punch Man
season 3. But yes, everyone, those are
basically it for today's video. I really
hope this video is sort of informative
or at least leave some impact towards
you guys. And if you guys actually watch
until the end, don't forget to comment
down M Rider in the comment section
below. And yes, those are basically it.
Thank you very much for watching this
video and I will see you in the next One
Punch Man video. Goodbye.
