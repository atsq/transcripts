The crash that everyone's talking about
right now will be worse than 2008, but
not in the way almost everyone thinks
it's going to happen. You see, the
media's been bracing you for another
crash, right? They're calling for a
housing collapse. They're calling for a
stock market wipeout, but that's not the
real danger. This time, the bubble isn't
in real estate. The bubble's not in
banks. It's in a completely different
sector that no one's watching. And when
it pops, the crash effects will be
nothing like what most people are
preparing for. And here's why this is so
dangerous. When the thing that everyone
thinks is safe is actually the bubble.
It means your savings, your retirement,
and even the cash in your pocket,
they're all on the firing line. Now,
real quick, I'm Mark Moss. I've built,
I've invested, I've sold companies
through multiple boom and bus markets.
Today, I'm a partner at a leading
Bitcoin venture hedge fund. And this is
the same data that we're looking at to
make decisions. And so I want to give it
to you so you can understand why this
crash is different, what the signs are
that nobody sees, and how you can
protect and even grow your wealth while
everyone else gets blindsided. So let's
go. All right, we got a lot of ground to
cover today, so we're going to go really
quick. Let's just jump right in. And the
big takeaway is this. Most people are
stuck fighting the last war, right? And
in our case, that means most people are
expecting a market crash like we had in
2008. That's the last war. Maybe they're
looking at 2000 or whichever period that
you want to look at. But those were
different. Those were deflationary
crashes. A housing market crash, a
credit bubble crash, a stock market
crash. But when these markets crashed,
we saw stocks drop right by more than
50%. Home prices, they collapsed 30 to
50%. Banks failed, unemployment
skyrocketed. That's what happened. And
as painful as that was, on the other
side of all that, we saw huge growth,
right? Because the crash was sort of
like a reset button. After the crash, if
you still had cash, you could get back
in, right? You could buy that home, you
could buy the stocks much cheaper, and
then you could ride the recovery back
up. That's why a lot of people today are
waiting for that. They're waiting for
the same type of crash. So, they've been
waiting on the sidelines. They've been
holding their cash. Some of these people
have been holding for two or three years
because mainstream media, other
prominent financial channels, online,
some other YouTubers, they continue to
tell you that this market crash is
coming. Look at the debt, they say,
right? Look at the inverted yield curve.
Look at all the other reasons. But
here's the thing, that's not what's
coming. And if you're waiting for
another 2008 crash, you're going to get
wiped out. Now, if you've been watching
my channel for I guess the last couple
years, you know that I broke off from
the entire pack back in October of 2022.
I made a video titled There is no market
crash coming and here's why. And then I
went on to continue making more videos
telling you, you know, what the Fed did,
what the bank collapse showed us. And
then in August of 2023, I made a video
titled that the bare market is canled.
December of 2023, I told you there would
be a crash, but this time it'd be
different. I called it the reverse
market crash because instead of
deflation, we're facing an inflationary
crash. That was almost two years ago.
And here's the crazy part. The market
since then has played out exactly as I
said it would. I mean, look at this.
Since I made that call in December of
2023, Bitcoin's up 186%. Gold, which so
many wrote off as dead money, has surged
almost 95%. Even the NASDAQ and the S&P
have moved higher, up 52% and 46%.
But notice what's lagging. The broader
market indexes like the Russell 2000,
right? It's barely up 30%. So if you'd
been sitting in cash on the sidelines
waiting for another 2008 style crash or
if you'd followed maybe Ray Dallio's
all-weather portfolio, which is the
classic Wall Street playbook, you'd be
way behind right now. Look at the
numbers. A simple equal weight
allocation in the top four assets,
Bitcoin, gold, NASDAQ, and the S&P would
have turned a $100,000 portfolio into
nearly $194,000
by October of 2025. Meanwhile, Ray
Dalio, the all-weather strategy would
have grown to about $118,000.
That's a difference of $76,000
in just 2 years. That's a 64%
outperformance just by positioning for
the reverse market crash that I called
back in 2023 instead of clinging to the
old playbook. So, while everyone else
was waiting in cash or trusting their
safe conventional strategies, the people
who followed this thesis were building
wealth at nearly double the pace. Now,
this is the power of understanding the
crash that we're actually in, right? Not
the one everyone thinks is coming. And
if you've been feeling like you can't
afford the same lifestyle that you had a
few years ago, congratulations. You're
already living through the early stages
of this reverse market crash. Okay, so
now the big question is if this isn't
like 2008, where is the real bubble
today? Because remember, every crash
starts with a bubble somewhere. Okay,
well if the bubble's not in housing and
it's not in the stock market, where is
it? Well, the real bubble, it's hiding
in plain sight, right? It's in the one
place that everyone thinks is safe. It's
government bonds and in the dollar
itself. Now think about it. The US
Treasury are supposed to be the safest
asset in the world. The dollar, it's the
foundation of global trade. But today,
both are being inflated by trillions of
dollars in new debt and endless central
bank printing. The US government is
borrowing over two trillion a year just
to stay afloat. And the only buyers that
are left are the Fed and passive flows
that are forced into treasuries by
regulation. Now, there's a recent report
that came out by Air McCann research.
And they put it bluntly. They said,
quote, "The current bubble is not like
2008, which was a credit bubble. It's a
currency and treasury bond bubble. And
when the foundation of the entire
financial system is the bubble, then
everything built on top of it, stocks,
pensions, real estate, even the paycheck
becomes unstable." End quote. This is
why I'm saying this crash is going to be
worse than 2008. Because when housing
collapsed, at least the money was still
good. But when money itself becomes the
bubble, there's no safety net. Okay. So,
how do we see that the bubble's in money
and not in stocks, not in real estate?
Well, the clues are everywhere. There
are the signals. There's the symptoms of
capital fleeing fiat. And when you see
them, the market begins to make a lot
more sense. All right. So, just look at
the stock market specifically. Let's
look at the MAG 7. These tech giants
have become so dominant, they now
represent roughly 34% of the S&P 500's
market cap as of August of 2025. In
2024, companies like Nvidia, Meta,
Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Tesla,
Alphabet, all of those, they drove more
than half of the S&P 500's gains. For
instance, last year in 2024, Nvidia
returned 171%, Meta 85%, Tesla 62%,
Amazon, Alphabet, Apple all posted
double digit gains. These are massive
returns, right? But these aren't bubbles
in those stocks. They're just the places
capital is going away from the cash. Now
these companies, they feel safer, right,
than holding dollars. So people pour
money into them as sort of like this
pseudo safe haven, right? Then you can
look at like other areas like the crypto
NFT market, especially like crypto
punks, right? People are spending
serious money on digital avatars.
Like what? Why? Well, the reason is
because when the underlying currency
feels unsafe, then you're willing to
just basically leap into anything that
gives some sense of scarcity and value
outside of fiat. And then of course
there's Bitcoin and gold, right? The
main beneficiaries of capital flight
right now today. We just looked at how
Bitcoin's up 185%, right? That's since
December of 2023. Gold's up 95%. Now,
the fact that these digital and metallic
safe havens have outperformed the bulk
of traditional assets isn't an accident,
right? Onchain flows confirm this. The
massive inflows into Bitcoin are often
predictive of future returns. That means
that people are quietly moving capital
into crypto because they see through the
illusion that cash is safe. So, what
looks irrational like NFTTS and tech
stock mania, cryptobubbles, it's
actually kind of rational when you
understand the context. These are safe
haven bids. They're not speculative
bets. If you view them through the
traditional lens, you call them bubbles.
But once you flip the lens, you see that
money is the thing crumbling. Then it
all starts making sense. Now, in another
video I'm going to do, I'm going to go
deeper and I'm going to show you a chart
from Weimar Republic Germany during
hyperinflation when gold looked
volatile. But the real story was the
currency was collapsing underneath it.
And of course, once you see that, you'll
never view volatility the same way
again.
Okay, so now you understand why this
next crash, it's different, right?
Here's why I say it's going to be worse
than 2008. Because in 2008, when the
bubble and you know, housing and credit
when all that collapsed, as as painful
as it was, as devastating as was, you
guys have heard my story. In 2008, I was
in real estate, I got wiped out, it was
also a reset, right? Homes got cheaper,
stocks went on sale, and eventually
those new buyers could step in. The next
generation had a chance to get back in,
right? And as much as it hurt, at least
there was an opportunity on the other
side. But today, with the bubble not
being in housing or credit, but instead
money itself, when the dollar and the
treasury bonds are the bubble, there's
no reset button, right? There's no
better chance to get in later. There's
no reset. I mean, think about what that
means. That means if you're waiting in
cash for another, I don't know, 2008
style collapse, you're not going to get
it. Instead of asset prices falling to
meet you, they're just going to keep
running away. Housing doesn't get
cheaper, it gets permanently out of
reach. Your savings don't become more
valuable, they get inflated into
nothing. Retirees on fixed income get
crushed. Young families get locked out
of the market. And the middle class,
they get hollowed out. That's why this
time's worse. In 2008, at least you got
another chance. This time, there's no
second chance. Unless you already own
the right assets before the systems
crap. Okay, now I know this sounds bad,
and it is, but it doesn't have to be for
you. doesn't have to be for you and I.
What are we going to do about this? How
do you not just survive this reverse
market crash, but actually come out
wealthier than ever before? Well, the
winners in this kind of crash are the
people who frontr run the collapse,
right? They own the scarce assets that
can't be printed away. Assets like
Bitcoin, right? Digital scarcity that
governments can't print. Gold, it's the
order oldest form of hard money. Prime
real estate, collectibles, businesses
with real cash flow that can rise with
inflation. Meanwhile, the losers,
they're the ones sitting in cash.
They're the ones hiding in government
bonds. They're the ones that are
thinking that they're playing it safe.
Or maybe they're in some other types of
diversified assets that won't keep up
with the rate of money printing,
monetary debasement, or what I call the
real rate of inflation. But for us,
because we see this coming, we don't
have to get wiped out. We don't have to
see the quality of our life decline. In
fact, you can use it as a once in a
generation chance to multiply your
wealth while everyone else is
blindsided. And if you want to see
exactly how the entire financial system
is being rebuilt right in front of our
eyes, you should probably go watch this
video right here and I'll see you over
there.
