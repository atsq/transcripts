From singing to fake AI crowds to
putting castles in their head as a
statement and getting cancelled by
Hollywood, the Will Smith family has
been going through it all. Ever since
that fateful night at the Oscars, the
Will Smith family has completely fallen
off of the map. And so in this video,
we're going to explore where the Smith
family is today and how one of the most
famous families turned into a parody of
all the things wrong with Hollywood and
fame culture. Let's begin with Will
Smith. Ever since the Oscar slap, he's
never really been able to get any
serious roles in Hollywood. His
relevance has completely died out.
Nobody cared about him and nobody wants
to be associated with him, not even his
own family. So, Will had to do something
drastic and it all started with, you
guessed it, Pretty Girls. Now, we've
spoken about this before, but things
have only gotten so much worse since. In
June 2025, Will dropped what might be
the most cringe-worthy song of the
decade. The track opens with Will
sitting in a therapist's office
describing his problem, which turns out
to be liking attractive women. Already,
you know, this is going to be rough.
It's a 50-year-old man with a broken
image, a broken family, rapping about
young, attractive women. Then he starts
rapping about different flavors of
women, vanilla, chocolate, strawberry,
lemon, and the internet absolutely clown
on it. You go on Tik Tok, YouTube,
anywhere, and you'll find he hasn't got
a single real fan. Just check out these
comments and critiques from literally
everyone from YouTube comments to Reddit
and newspaper and music critic
headlines. Even the people you would
expect to like Will Smith called it
exploitative and noted the potentially
unintentionally creepy lyrics. The song
was part of his album based on a true
story, his first in 20 years, which
completely bombed and became the worst
reviewed album of the year. Pitchfork
gave it a brutal 2.4 out of 10, calling
it a pointless apology tour that was
devoid of perspective or style. The
reviewer wrote, "It felt like a campaign
platform with one message. Please take
me back." Rolling Stone wasn't any
kinder, describing the album as clunky
and weighed down by cringy gospel tinged
platoonous rap. The Independent gave it
two out of five stars, saying it lacked
innovation and came across as quasy
inspirational songs that lacked energy.
And these are the people that should be
loving Will Smith, the previous idol of
Hollywood, the guy who would say
whatever he needed to say and do
whatever he needed to do by Hollywood
elites. And the commercial performance
was even worse than the reviews. The
album completely failed to chart in the
Billboard 200, obviously, and it was
Will's first album to ever achieve that
level of commercial failure. In the UK,
it sold just 268 copies in its first
week and only managed to hit number 79
on the download charts. And to be
honest, most people probably buying this
are doing for the meme. As that's not a
typo, 268 copies. Local indie bands
often sell more copies at a single
concert. To promote this masterpiece, he
decided to perform at London's King
Cross Station. And he definitely didn't
manage to rescue his image as he asked
for the crowd to chant and dance along
only for them to stand there like
cardboard cutouts. Viewers then
described it as having no energy, no
response. Nada. With nobody dancing
along, nobody even looks happy. And if
he thought busing at train stations was
rock bottom, Will had other plans. By
August 2025, during his European tour,
Will sung so low that he posted a video
showing massive crowds cheering for him.
Except the crowds were fake AI. People
immediately spotted digitally mangled
faces, nonsensical finger placements,
and people moving like they're in the
Sims. The comments were brutal. Imagine
being this rich and famous and having to
use AI footage of crowds and bulk
comments on your video. Tragic man, you
used to be cool. The whole thing was
such a catastrophe that Will's planned
massive comeback tour had to be scaled
down significantly. When your album
flops so hard that you have to tour
smaller venues in places like Scarra and
Wolverampton instead of major
metropolitan areas, you know you've hit
rock bottom. And if anyone knows a
Scarra, they'll know how comical this
really is. I mean, just think about how
desperate you have to be to fit your own
crowd sizes, especially when you were
the most famous man in the world at one
point. This is a man who once performed
for actual soldout stadiums around the
world. Now reduced to manufacturing
digital fans because the real ones have
moved on, performing local gigs in
Wolverampton. Really, Will's fans grew
up when he didn't. You could get away
with tacky music in the 90s. Smith's
early hits like Miami and Summertime
really didn't sound too different to
Pretty Girls, but they were released 30
years ago, and he was cool back then. He
hadn't had his image completely
destroyed. And let it sink in and remind
yourself that Will Smith is now pushing
60 years old. Aside from the album and
tour, Will was persistent in bringing
back his rap career when he released the
lyrical lemonade freestyle from March
2025, bringing the cringe to a whole new
level. He's sitting there in front of
what looks like a school lunch trying to
convince everyone he still got it. The
lines are just painful. I pulled a pen
out of the grenade on purpose when I
threw it. Like, yeah, that's how
grenades work. And then he keeps saying,
"This is the bounce back over and over
like if he says it enough times, it'll
actually happen." The whole thing just
feels awkward. It's like watching your
dad try to freestyle at a family
barbecue. Everyone's just uncomfortable.
As his music career imploded, Will then
tried to resurrect his acting reputation
with Bad Boys Ride or Die in 2024. While
the movie did make money, many said it
felt calculated and desperate rather
than a genuine comeback. The Hollywood
Reporter revealed that Smith's agents
had been calling studio production
executives for the first time since the
slap, trying to drum up work. They were
literally using Bad Boys 4 as a test
case to see if anyone would still hire
him. It felt like it was his Hail Mary,
his last shot at movie star relevance.
And to be fair to Will, he did set his
conditions for his return for a possible
Bat Boys 5, saying, "I never wanted to
be one of those dudes who make sequels
just because people will go." But that's
exactly what this feels like. A
desperate attempt to milk a franchise
that peaked decades ago. A great
metaphor for his own personality. As
behind the scenes of Will's desperience,
his personal life and marriage were
completely falling apart in a more
serious way. And here you can really
feel how as a part of the Hollywood
machine, he and his family kind of just
stopped being people and instead turned
into brands and commodities. As in
October 2023, Jada dropped a bombshell
that changed everything we thought we
knew about the Oscar slap. During her
promotional tour of her book, Worthy,
she revealed that she and Will had
actually been separated since 2016,
meaning they hadn't been living together
as a couple for 7 years. So, when Will
slapped Chris Rock and shouted, "Keep my
wife's name out of your mouth," he was
defending a woman who wasn't technically
his wife anymore. Think about that for a
second. The most famous public defense
of a marriage in recent history was
actually a lie. They kept up the charade
for the cameras and for the brands and
movie roles. Jada said that they were
exhausted with trying and stuck in their
fantasy of what we thought the other
person should be. When her book finally
came out, which was supposed to be a big
comeback moment, it became another
cringe-worthy spectacle. But before we

the Essential Open earbuds are stealing

disaster. quote, "We just lived through
Jada's memoir roll out." "And I'm
tired," said Sam Saunders on his podcast
into it. "Even Saturday Night Live got
in on the action. The book itself was a
commercial flop with just 23% of people
recommending it on Google. The reviews
were brutal. I read mostly biography,
almost never fiction. I watched all the
episodes of Red Table Talk, so was
looking forward to this book. There is
nothing new here, and it's not even well
written. You can skip this book."
Another reader wrote, "What a stupid,
stupid book. Completely not worth the
money." After about 30 pages, I had
enough. Speaking of Red Table Talk, that
was another thing that objectively hurt
the Smith family as a whole. Jada's talk
show with a terrible 2.9 out of 10
rating on IMDb gave the world an overly
intimate look at the whole family. It
exposed the family for the sake of
virtually nothing. The most infamous
episode was the entanglement one where
Jada admitted to her affair with her
son's friend who was 27 while she was
48. The episode spawns the sad Will
Smith meme that went viral, showing Will
looking absolutely miserable as his wife
casually discussed cheating on him.
Decades ago, the average person knew
very little about their favorite movie
star. With Will, Jada, and their kids,
Willow and Jaden, everyone seemingly
knows too much about their famous
family. The financial pressure probably
didn't help their relationship either.
Will's media company Westbrook, which he
built with Jada, has been hemorrhaging
money since the slap. Before 2022, they
were bringing in around $170 million
annually and had turned down a $600
million buyouts offer. After the slap,
their revenue dropped to just $100
million in 2023, forcing them to lay off
half their staff and lose major deals.
Sure, it's still massive figures, but
you just get the sense that the whole
situation has taken a serious toll on
Will's mental health. It's what's led
him to do all these weird collaborations
with any random influencer, just trying
to stay relevant no matter what. and he
has actually been open about struggling
with depression, which is at least
somewhat redeemable. But it seemed like
Jada again brought this to the public's
attention in a way that didn't really
show Will much respect, as people
pointed out that the way her family's
revelations were handled seem to
prioritize content and publicity over
privacy and dignity. The pattern of
exposing intimate family struggles for
the public to consume, from their
marriage problems to their children's
mental health issues, all feels really
uncomfortable and ultimately damaging
for the family. But it's not like Will
has tried to tame his ego, though.
Instead of handling the whole slap
incident quietly, he decided to double
down with a Chris Rock diss track.
During an appearance on Apple Music's
Fire in the Booth series, he clearly
references the instant, spitting, "If
you talking crazy out your face up on
the stage and disrespect me on the
stage, expect me on the stage." 2 years
later and Will is still trying to make
Chris Rock the villain in his story.
Again, he's 57 years old. So, with all
that in mind, take a second to imagine
what life has been like for Jaden, Will
Smith's own son. While Will spent
decades working his tail off to become
the best product he could, he had that
level of fame, notoriety, and societal
pressures hanging around his neck from
the moment he was conceived. Despite his
parents' best efforts, he had zero
chance of a normal childhood. And that
isn't just speculation on our part.
Jaden himself said as much. In a 2018
interview, he told Teen Vogue, "People
treat me like I'm not a normal human so
much that you start to believe it. Like,
am I not a normal human?" At the 2025
Grammy Awards, this pressure manifested
in perhaps the most ridiculous way
possible. Jaden showed up wearing a
literal castle on his head. The $4,600
piece called The Vampire Castle was
designed by a Transian designer who
claims to have descended from nobility.
But rather than his weird fashion
choices, it's the blatant nepatism that
has frustrated most people about Jaden.
This became painfully obvious in late
2024 when Jaden was named Christian
Labotin's first men's creative director,
sparking massive backlash about nepotism
in the fashion industry. People
criticize that the fashion industry is
already one of the toughest to break
into. And instead of opening the doors
for real talent, it feels like most
opportunities go straight to celebrity
kids, nepo babies, or famous
individuals. But the castle headpiece
and nepotism aren't even the most absurd
things about Jaden. In 2022, old clips
were surfaced of him complaining that
kids his age just didn't want to discuss
the political and economic state of the
world. In an interview with Big Boy TV,
Jaden said, "I am very happy that I
spent my childhood with more adults than
I did with kids my age because I was
picking up more things from adults than
I were from kids my own age. And I look
and I I go around sometimes and I hang
out with other people that are my age
and they're just kind of
my phone selfie. I'm just like, dude,
like, oh my god. Like, can we talk about
like the political and economic state of
the world right now? Can we talk about
what's going on with the environment?
Can we talk about other things? Of
course, the internet absolutely
demolished him for this. One meme said,
"Jaden Smith on his way to curse out his
kindergarten classmates for not
understanding the complexities behind
the current political climate." Another
showed a crying Spongebob with the
caption, "8-year-old Jaden Smith when
Jada gave him a Spider-Man themed
birthday party instead of a book study
on the War of Mesopotamia." Jeden
eventually made his own meme poking fun
at himself, posting a poker face photo
with the caption, "Me. Hey, want to talk
about the economic and political state
of the world together? Go." Nah, me.
Okay, cool. But this whole episode
perfectly captured the Jaden problem. A
kid who never had a childhood trying to
sound wise and important when he really
just comes across as pretentious and out
of touch. But with his parents, it's
kind of hard to expect anything else
would happen. And the fact that he
supported his dad's Oscar slap by the
tweet saying, "And that's how we do it."
shows the same misguided sense of
righteousness. This is what happens when
celebrity kids in LA mistake privilege
for wisdom. Jaden's recent musical
output also reads like something
straight out of the Smith's very public
Hollywood tragedy. His 2024 Project 2024
case study on the long-term effects of
young love sounds exactly like what it
is. The pretentious ramblings of someone
trying too hard to sound deep. I
honestly wanted to make it because I'm
sad Jaden described to the press and
that's not funny in itself, but you
can't help but feel he's been a bit
wrecked by his family life. Many
celebrities want to shield their
children from the media. But Will and
Jada ultimately failed to do so. They
pushed them straight into the Hollywood
industry. As Will even admitted their
parenting approach was a very, very,
very terrible mistake, saying they told
their kids they could do whatever they
want as long as they confess afterwards.
So, it probably won't surprise you that
Willow hasn't been spared from the
controversy. In August 2025, she posted
a crying selfie on Instagram with an
explicit caption that sparked massive
backlash. Instead of quietly deleting
the post and moving on, Willow doubled
down with a response that was peak Smith
family tone-deafness.
>> Y'all [ __ ] so dense y'all forgot funny
existing.
>> Calling her critics dense for not
understanding her humor. A classic Smith
move. When in doubt, blame everyone else
for not understanding your genius. But
then she made a more serious error that
again shows how totally out of touch
Hollywood kids really are. her debut
novel, Black Shield Maiden, talking
about Muslims indigenous to North Africa
as dangerous on their best day with
little regard for anyone who doesn't
worship the Muslim god and always at war
with one another. Obviously, Hollywood
and the press bashed it as you'd expect.
But the ironic part here was that Willow
was actually positioning herself as this
champion of marginalized voices and
communities. But when she tried to do
this with her own writing, she
completely missed the mark. What we're
watching isn't just individual cases of
celebrity desperation. It's an entire
family that's lost the plot and being
completely ruined by fame and
superficial people. Will is now faking
crowd sizes and releasing therapy rap
songs. Jaden is wearing castles on his
head and getting fashion jobs he doesn't
deserve. Jada is oversharing their
family trauma and pretending it's
spiritual growth. It's something
straight out of GTA 5. And it also says
something about society as a whole that
everyone collectively agreed that
celebrities and their kids don't deserve
the same level of privacy afforded to
many of us. But they kind of brought it
on themselves. Which is why the family
that once seemed to have it all has
become a cautionary tale about what
happens when the pursuit of attention
becomes more important than
authenticity.
