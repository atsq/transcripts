so there's one move in the golf swing
that is perhaps the most misunderstood
and even demonized move that you could
ever make hardly any videos are out
there or articles are out there telling
you to do what I'm about to show you but
when you do you're going to unlock an
entirely new world of distance and
accuracy don't believe me you're going
to try it for yourself but you'll never
go back to all the other conventional
wisdoms when you've tried this for
yourself so if you're looking for more
distance and accuracy I mean Mega
distance I want you to stay tuned cuz
right after this is coming
up hey this is Steve from hit it longer.
comom I continue my journey to hit the
ball longer and straighter than I ever
have before I'd love to show you how to
do this too all right so the move in
question is super ultra simple it's
simply the right hand or maybe the trail
hand if you're left-handed I'll call it
the trail
hand at the top of the Swing hopefully
you've got your wrist wound out up like
this so something like that like a
waiter holding a tray of pizza as he
walks through a restaurant like that so
your RIS this is in what we might call
extension pinned back now there's all
kinds of drills and tools and
conventional wisdom that tells you that
you're supposed to
maintain this
angle through impact otherwise you
cannot hit a compress the ball or I
don't know forward lean all that
stuff but if you look at all other
sports and you actually look at the
golfers themselves and zoom in on what
they're actually doing you'll be
shocked because they're all moving into
flexion in other words they're letting
the hand whip past the armb bones and
move into this position well you'd say
Steve that's flippy that's cuppy that's
casty you can't time that Steve you
can't time that so some of you will turn
off the video now because you've thrown
up on yourself and that's
okay you won't get to the good stuff
like if you're still
watching going to gets a lot of benefit
out of this now just like in any other
sport I'm going to play a few analogous
videos for you just to show you that
basically in any swinging or striking
sport this motion is made this wrist
snap is made Let's at overhand baseball
pitch you can see the pitches coming
out hand down like this very forceful
and free snap of the wrist so the hand
points downwards just after the ball
it's their hand is like this a
b this Ball's pitcher's wrist is
operating almost dling from the ligament
so they can be free to respond to the
Elbow
snapping okay let's look at another one
and that's again similar motion but with
an Implement a tennis serve or tennis
Slam Tennis looks like
that same thing we got a wrist snap and
the hand turns down like
this let's look at uh one of the Home
Run current home run Kings right now
Bryce Harper he's a lefty so it'll be
harder for me to demonstrate but I want
you to see we'll stop it early in his
follow through and by God sure you have
some pronation too but that wrist is
coming into slight
flexion he is snapping that wrist yeah
it's going over
too which most home run hitters will do
is pronate the rear hand over and hook
the
ball down on the line or into the alley
but he's got flexion let's look at one
more another one that's very easy to
tell and that's super slow motion these
are some great quality videos that I
found here here's a softball pitchure
very
skilled uh possibly college or even
Olympic level so top top top you can
clearly see as she comes
through that her wrist she's got a
little pronation too she might be trying
to throw a a curve of some kind but
she's going into freely into
flexion you cannot get
power without this you're never going to
hit it out there reason one of the big
reasons that you don't hit it out
there is because you've been taught to
impede this move like it's
evil this is this is the devil because
of course it would make you cast right
and sure that would be true if I never
remove my body at all and I just throw
that club yeah I'm going to be casty and
Scoopy but what's really wrong here the
wrist itself is in perfect position
let's look at
Hogan even Hogan now Hogan slightly
delayed this move to hit the fade and
we'll see how to do that in a second but
he also impeded a little bit he he
wasn't as
free tiger was the same way not super
free and yet still look at Hogan when he
goes through impact to about here his
wrist is in this
position he's just doing it
here if you're doing it here is it too
early no you fired the wrist free and in
time you just simply don't have the body
motion to accompany it you're all wrist
and arm and no step and rotation
which is the same step and snap as all
these other sports tennis Rock back step
snap softball step snap baseball step
snap
hitting step
snap why would golf be so much
different it's crazy that this has been
demonized this little motion
even now some of you are heading down to
comments to say this is flippy you'll
never be able to time this well how do
the baseball pitchers the softball
pitchers even Javelin throwers how do
they control mean baseball pitchers have
to be super accurate more so probably
than golfers do to throw that ball right
over not just a 17-in wide plate but the
outer third or the inner third
5 6 in 8 in window from 60 ft very very
tight with their accuracy same thing
with up and
down everybody in every sport has timing
to the step in the
snap that's just inherent now doesn't
mean that this has to
be casty flippy that's not what I look
like I'm releasing the hell out of it
but I promise you
I am flapping it so
free but I guarantee you right at the
moment of
impact because I'm moving my Pivot and
rotating my body at the same time or
slightly even in the
lead that I'm arriving at impact with a
slightly forward leaning
shaft with my wrist just before it
arrives at anatomically neutral which
would be right about here
so I am still in a very
slight extension but You' Get Fooled by
the photograph into thinking I held it
and waited and waited and waited and
maybe let it go after but that's not the
case the force to do that ramps up way
back here starts ramping up reaches its
peak here starts to un ramp as you
actually flop free from the ligaments
here your Club is now just responding in
to that Force you put on it and it's
bending your wrist for you now probably
and I'm just relaxing and freewheeling
down at the
bottom however it's the
sequence where I'm going to go step
rotate
snap got to have that in the sequence if
you're going to make this come out right
however when you can freely
flap and for those of you willing to
take this on for the first
time and really
snap whip the wrist through the
results are just amazing is the distance
and the accuracy you can hit the ball is
ridiculous compared to trying to hold it
imagine a batter trying to hold their
wrist and time it right to where the
pitch is going to hit the bat your swing
would look like
this now that's a check swing we know
what that is that's a check swing my
right wrist is still in extension I have
not let the head
go so all I'm looking for you to do is
throw that thing throw it without
impedance throw it without
tension make your hand feel like it's
flopping back and forth and feel like
you're cracking a whip or cracking a
towel instead you're going to pick up so
much speed let's give it one more look
from a totally different angle you'll be
able to
see
how again your comments about oh you
it's hard to time this
Steve I'm not making the toe roll over
with this action let's look at the
action by
itself wrist
extension wrist flexion look at that the
club arcs
beautifully while the club face stays
squared to the ark I'm advancing the
club 30° this way 30° this way and
keeping the face dead
Square to the
ark we're going to come down wrist is in
extension but it is rapidly
straightening I'm not waiting I'm
throwing I'm applying Force to the shaft
to make it speed up here I come in the
club face is dead Square to the ark
strike it
Square my body is
cleared the shaft is leaning forward
I've got a ball First Strike I'm not
holding or impeding this for This Magic
Moment not going for a photograph I am
whipping now after that I come out I'm
going into flexion for the first time
here yes I'm trying to go into it from
the top but because of my body
rotation I don't catch up until here but
watch this club face squared to the ark
all the way around the curve towards you
let's take a look at that
now try to slow it
down and see the same behavior
[Music]
[Music]
very straight shot let's look at that in
slow motion and you can see the club
coming around the ark my wrist is
flapping
free accelerating the club to a high
speed with very little
effort and keeping the face Square to
the arc there can't be a better motion
this motion you might demonize it you
may turn it off and say Steve you're
crazy I'm just going to go back to the
conventional wisdom that says you're
supposed to hold this as long as you can
and I'm going to keep hitting 210 220
230 off the te instead of 2802
9300 which you can
do if you follow this by the way just
about everybody on TV does
this you've gotten fooled by a
photograph or a slow motion video a lot
of instructors have gotten fooled
thinking oh it looks like they're
holding the wrist but now that we can
measure the forces acting on the club
that's telling a whole new story that
we're actually throwing the club and
accelerating the club from way back here
throwing that wrist into this position
just like a baseball pitcher
steps turns and snaps with the wrist
turning down like this
so just like every other sport of course
there's timing
involved big secret there's timing
involved
however we're not going to hit it fat
we're not going to cast you're going to
look when you have the pivot down you're
going to
look so lag
even while you're
pushing trying to straighten the force
you're just not seeing the response of
the wrist in the club head till a little
later but that doesn't mean the force
isn't trying to grind that angle open
accelerate the club You' just got to do
it in the right
order step turn
snap just like you learned when you
threw a ball for the first time when you
were 2 years old when you swung a bat
for the first time at 3 years
old anything like this you probably have
already learned how to do but you've
been coached out of
it by a lot of golf instruction that's
looking at a
photograph that looks like
this even
Hogan goes into this
position the freest are the hitters that
go the furthest with the least amount of
effort and so in my generation and my
golf history that's Fred Couples and
Dustin Johnson super long but they just
don't look like they're swinging that
fast you can see they're going freely
into slight flexion this
way and then going over the shoulder
letting the club fly around the circle
without impeding it or trying to slow it
down or control it or delay it it's just
simple green light all the way from the
top it makes it so easy to a club like
this hey I hope you'll give this a try
how will you know when you're doing this
because you're going to make a swish
sound the only way you're going to make
a swish sound you can't make a swish
sound holding the
wrist snap it make it swish make it
swish louder make it swish louder and
you're going to be able to see the
action that I'm talking about it's going
to be a huge game Cher for some people
out there I hope so if it is for you
leave it down in the comments I'm very
excited to read them in about a week or
two so here we go step turn
snap around the circle the circle is
this
way step
turn and snap that right hand through
just like
this I think you're going to get some
really outstanding
results hey thanks so much for watching
and considering this motion that I think
Universal among good players but they
don't know it or they try to coach them
out of it I'm Steve head over to my
website hit longer. comom for hundreds
more videos and articles that I'm sure
are also going to help you improve your
golf game and as usual I'll either see
you in the next video or I'll see you
longer and straighter down the Fairway
Everybody Take Good Care
oh
