If you suffer from lower back pain and
you've tried static stretching to fix
it, you've probably noticed by now that
it doesn't really work. Most stretches
are a waste of time. They feel good for
the 5 seconds that you're doing them,
but once you stop, the pain creeps right
back in. That's because stretching pulls
on irritated tissue and never really
fixes the root cause of the problem.
Why? Because your lower back isn't the
actual problem. It's the victim of a
broken system. You don't need more
stretching. You need better movement.
And that comes with more stability, more
control, and more truth in how your body
moves. I've worked with thousands of
people who thought that they had back
issues. Some of them even contemplating
surgeries. But what they really had was
a movement issue. So, in this video, I'm
going to show you three powerful and
simple exercises that you can use to
rebuild your foundation. They only take
5 minutes a day, but the relief that's
going to stick with you for a long time.
So, let's start with why you're
experiencing back pain in the first
place. Most people think their back
hurts because something's wrong with the
back itself. But, as with any pain,
injury, or discomfort, the root cause is
usually stemming from somewhere else in
your body. And when it comes to the
lower back, that usually results because
the spine is doing way too much and more
than it should because the rest of the
body is not operating as it needs to.
So, here's what usually happens. Your
hip flexors are weak and tight, usually
from sitting too much and keeping them
in a chronically flexed position. Your
glutes aren't firing properly, which
usually means they are weak in
extension. and your posture is all kinds
of wrong with some of us resembling
weathered prawns while the rest of us
look like we're on a night out in the
club practicing some twerking. So all
these issues combined lead to mechanical
problems, movement problems,
compensations throughout your body and
eventually chronic back pain that you
sometimes struggle to deal with. That
changes the position of your spine and
suddenly your lower back is under
constant pressure just from standing or
walking around. And then add to that the
fact that most people never train their
spine to actually move. You go through
your day-to-day life barely rotating,
barely bending, barely extending, barely
flexing. Then you hit the gym and you
move in clean straight lines. Your
squats, your deadlifts, your machines,
all sagittal or robotic. But your spine
was built to rotate, flex, extend,
sidebend. It wants complexity. It wants
variety. It wants confidence in
movement. So when you don't give it
that, it stiffens, it braces, and
eventually it starts to hurt. If you're
not training complex ranges, if your
hips are stiff, your core isn't
stabilizing properly, and your spine
never learns how to bend with control,
your back will start to take on loads it
was never meant to handle. It's not
about pain tolerance. It's about load
management. And most spines are just
overloaded by dysfunction elsewhere.
People often assume that tightness
equals a need for stretching when in
actual fact tightness is mostly the
result of weakness and instability. And
stretching a weak muscle will only lead
to more injuries and dysfunctions. While
there is a time and a place for
stretching, what we need to do is
strengthen. So, let me show you three
simple moves that will help you get
immediate relief. So, exercise number
one, you're going to get into a long
lunge. I call this the lizard rotation.
From this position, you're going to
place both hands next to your foot. And
you're just going to give it a nice
little stretch out there. Then you're
going to take the outside hand. You're
going to thread it through. So try to go
as far as you can and then twist to the
opposite side. And you're going to hear
all kinds of cracking and popping noises
here, which is exactly what we like. And
you're going to move through it. Keep
the back leg as close to the ground as
possible and keep quite stable because
your body will want to rotate
and you need to stabilize those hips and
that core in order to stay in position.
So you're going to repeat this. You can
do it for reps 10 to 12 or you can do it
uh for time working for a minute each
each position. So here, place both
hands. Then you're going to reach under
and you're going to rotate.
And you're always going to find that one
side is stronger than the other. So make
sure that you always work the weaker
side and match the the stronger side to
it. Exercise number two, we're going to
work the spinal flexion. So you're going
to stand. If you don't have a lot of
mobility at this time, you're just going
to use your body weight. If you're good
with flexing your spine, then you're
going to add load because that load will
help you both get stronger and get
deeper in the position. So, you're going
to take your barbell, your stick, or
just body weight, and you're going to
flex as far as you can, and once you've
reached that bottom position, you're
going to bounce to either side. Okay?
So, I lift a bit and I bounce. I'm doing
this slowly to demonstrate, but I want
you to eventually get to a place where
you're bouncing
more dynamically. So, you're going to do
a couple bounces and then you're going
to flex back up through that Jefferson
curl to standing. So, imagine if I was
standing on a box right now. I've got my
dumbbell, my barbell, my kettle bell,
whatever I'm using. It's going to pull
me down into a really deep Jefferson
curl, right? So my hands will be past my
legs and then I'm going to bounce with
control.
Okay? So we're rotating, we're flexing,
we're dynamically moving, we're building
resilience and robustness in that spine.
So you can do that for reps 5 to seven
or as I said work for time, do a minute.
Okay. And exercise number three is what
I call the quadripedal to tabletop
rotation. So, we're working both
protraction in the spine and we're
working extension on the opposite side.
So, you're going to get down on all
fours. You're going to protract. So,
think about separating your shoulder
blades away from each other. Push the
ground. Keep the knees nice and close.
You're going to take one leg. You're
going to thread it through. And you're
going to rotate. Keep your hips nice and
high. And you're going to push up to the
sky, extending your hips. Then you're
going to come back to that position.
Then you're going to repeat on the other
side. Rotate.
Lift the hips up nice and high. Don't
arch your lower back. Keep your pelvis
tucked. Reach. Hold.
And come back to position. And then
you're slowly going to be moving around,
holding that extension,
and coming back. So, this one's going to
be really tough on the shoulder as well.
And we know that often times back pain
can even stem from the shoulder. So, we
want to be strengthening the hips, the
glutes, the ankles, the shoulders, the
core, lower back, upper back, all of it.
And that's what's going to help you
avoid back pain in the long run, not
your little 30-second stretches after a
workout. That's passive. That's not
building strength. So, don't be afraid
of movement. Utilize it. Get stronger.
Get more resilient over time, and your
back pain will disappear. that I
promised you. These three movements do
more than just stretch. They retrain
your body to work as a system. We're
creating space in the hips, control in
the spine, stability through the core,
and confidence in your body and in
movement. Your back doesn't want
babying. It wants support. It wants to
feel safe again. It wants to build
strength, robustness, and resilience.
When your body moves the way that it's
designed to, pain doesn't have much of a
place to live. Try these exercises
today. Just one round, 5 minutes. See
how your body responds. Not just in your
back, but how you move, stand, breathe,
and recover. If it helps, let me know in
the comments. And if you've dealt with
back pain, share this with someone else
who might need it, too. And if you want
more movement tools that actually change
how your body feels forever, then check
out Moose's method. This is more than
pain relief. This is movement for a
