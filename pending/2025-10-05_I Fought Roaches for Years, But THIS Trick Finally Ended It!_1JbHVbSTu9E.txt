This is how I finally got rid of a
problem I had been struggling with for
years. A simple trick, and it works
better than I expected. Tear off a piece
of aluminum foil. Use it as a base for
the mixture. Take a cup, turn it upside
down, and cover it with foil. Carefully
remove it without ruining the shape.
You'll have a tall foil bowl.
Place it on the stove and add three
tablespoons of ground coffee. Coffee has
a strong smell that repels insects.
Add a handful of cloves. They have
powerful antibacterial properties and
repel thanks to their eugenal content.
Finally, sprinkle in some cinnamon.
Cinnamon has antifungal effects and
releases a strong aroma that enhances
this trick. Turn on the stove and heat
it up. Once the mixture starts to
smolder and release smoke, spread it
throughout your home. It's a natural and
effective way to get rid of cockroaches,
flies, mosquitoes, and other annoying
insects. No chemicals needed, just
products you already have in your
kitchen.
Drop mothballs into dish soap. This
simple trick solves a problem many
people struggle with. Since I discovered
it, I haven't spent a single dollar on
storebought products. Start with a piece
of paper towel and place exactly four
mothballs in the center. Fold the paper
in half and crush the mothballs with a
meat tenderizer until you get a fine
powder. Take any dish soap you have at
home. It has many uses, but in this
case, it works exceptionally well.
Measure about half a cup of dish soap
and pour it into a tall container. Add
the mothball powder. Then pour in about
2 cups of room temperature water. Add 1
tbsp of alcohol. It disinfects and
boosts the effectiveness of the other
ingredients.
Now add one capful of fabric softener
for a pleasant scent and a light
protective layer.
Prepare an empty plastic bottle,
preferably with a dispensing cap, and
pour the mixture into it. For the final,
very important ingredient, add a few
cloves. Their strong scent repels
insects. You've just made an effective
homemade insect killer and repellent. It
works on flies, mosquitoes, ants, and
cockroaches. Use it on floors or
surfaces like furniture, and you'll keep
unwanted bugs out of your home.
Wasps and hornets will stay far away
from your home. Thanks to this simple
trick, you won't see them again. All you
need to do is spray this mixture around
door and window frames. These insects
can be a serious problem around the
house. They're often aggressive, even
when unprovoked. If you notice a bee,
it's a sign that wasps might be coming
soon. Time to protect your home.
I have a natural solution that works
wonders and takes just minutes to make.
Wasps and hornets have a very sensitive
sense of smell. And there's one scent
they absolutely hate. Cloves, a spice
most of us love. Here's what to do. Take
a handful of cloves, pour hot water over
them,
and let them steep until cool. Strain
the liquid through a sie.
Then pour it into a spray bottle.
Spray it around doors, windows,
balconies, or patios to repel wasps and
discourage them from building nests.
I placed it all around the house. And I
couldn't believe the results. Prepare a
small dish. Add 3 tsp of coffee. Add 2
tsp of dried or fresh mint. Add half a
teaspoon of cinnamon. Mix all the
ingredients together. Prepare a small
piece of aluminum foil.
Sprinkle a pinch of the mixture onto it.
Fold it in such a way and poke holes in
it with a toothpick. Prepare a few such
foil packets. Cover the rest of the
mixture with a larger piece of aluminum
foil. Poke a few holes in the foil with
a toothpick. Place this dish on a window
sill or a shelf. Leave the small foil
packets in various places around the
house. You can place them by the doors,
on the window sill, or in kitchen
cabinets. The ingredients in this
mixture repel many insects such as
flies, mosquitoes, ants, moths, and even
spiders. At the end of summer, it's the
perfect way to protect your home from
various pests.
Hang a bag like this by your front door.
It protects against dangerous insects.
Have you noticed a wasp nest hanging
near your home? The first thing to do is
stay calm. Avoid disturbing these
insects
as they can fiercely defend their nest
and queen. Luckily, you can prevent them
from nesting on your property. Let me
share a brilliant trick used by a
professional gardener.
Next time you're at the store, ask for a
large paper bag. That's all you need to
scare the wasps away. When you hang a
crumpled oval-shaped paper bag near your
entrance, it resembles a wasp nest.
Wasps are territorial and avoid places
where another colony might already
exist. This simple trick makes them
think there's already a nest nearby, so
they move on. You won't have to worry
about removing real nests if you stop
them from building in the first place.
Try this method today. It's an easy and
clever solution that really works.
A brilliant trap for wasps and hornets.
I hang it a few meters from the terrace
so I can enjoy meals outside in peace.
Making it is incredibly simple. First,
you'll need an ordinary plastic bottle.
Use a utility knife to cut it about 1/3
of the way up.
Insert the cut off top part back inside
upside down. Then, using a soldering
iron or a heated wire, poke two holes.
They should go through both layers of
the bottle.
Next, add two tablesp of white sugar to
the bottom. Take some regular string,
cut two pieces, and thread them through
the holes.
Now, bring the bottle out to the
terrace. Finally, crack open a hoppy
beer. I just bought the cheapest one at
the store. and pour it into the trap.
Hang it on a fence or tree a few meters
from the terrace. The sweet scent will
lure the wasps in, and once they fly
inside, they won't be able to escape.
You'll never see flies and mosquitoes in
your house again. If you're interested
in ways to repel mosquitoes, I'll show
you a simple method. You'll learn how to
make your own mosquito spray. It doesn't
contain any chemicals, but it has
everything flies and mosquitoes hate.
Just spray it on door and window frames
and no insect will come near them.
Prepare a container. Pour in a cup of
water. Add a tablesp of ground cinnamon.
Cinnamon has properties that repel these
insects. It also works very effectively
on ants and gnats. Mix everything well.
Cinnamon repels unwanted insects with
its smell. Pour the mixture into a spray
bottle using a funnel. To prevent the
sprayer from clogging, strain the
mixture through cheesecloth or a coffee
filter. This is one of the easiest and
most effective sprays for mosquitoes and
flies. Mosquitoes and flies hate this
scent. Just spray the frame of your
front and balcony doors. Also, spray the
window frames. Additionally, you can
spray it on your plants. It won't harm
them. On the contrary, cinnamon has many
benefits for plants. It protects them
from diseases, stimulates their growth,
and regulates soil pH. If you spray your
trash can, no flies will hover over the
waste. This one spice will provide you
with the best and most original spray to
repel flies and mosquitoes. Hang it on a
tree and you'll quickly get rid of that
annoying problem.
This little pouch will also work well in
the house. It's a simple yet effective
method. Take some aluminum foil and tear
off a piece. Foil is not only good for
storing food, but also has hidden uses.
Fold the foil into a larger rectangle
and fold the edges tightly to keep it
from falling apart. Carefully make a
small hole at the top using a
screwdriver. Now take a string and cut a
piece of the right length.
Secure it carefully to the foil. The
pouch should look like this. Its
function is simple but effective. You
can hang it on a window door or even on
a tree. This will keep flies from
appearing in your home.
The light reflecting off the foil on a
sunny day effectively repels them. These
insects avoid the flickering reflections
that they associate with it.
This small but clever trick can be
indispensable, especially in the summer
when the insect problem becomes
particularly bothersome.
