his subscriber tends to pull the right arm a lot during the backswing.
At impact, they often get stuck and hit a lot of fat shots and shanks.
Let’s take a look at the swing.
Upper body tilts too early during the takeaway.
Right arm gets pulled in right after the takeaway
At impact, the body falls backward, leading to a scooped shot and a fat hit.
At the start of the backswing,
At the start of the backswing, their body shifts left early and doesn't rotate much—resulting in a limited takeaway.
If I simulate that by shifting left
and doing a one-arm backswing, I don’t feel any pulling at all.
But in a real swing, we use both arms.
So if I try to place my left hand,
with my body already shifted left,
I can’t reach the right hand easily.
그래서 오른손이 이렇게
As a result,
the right hand ends up pulling like this.
So when the body tilts too early,
there’s not enough rotation.
And when you try to swing with both hands, the arms pull in.
It’s the same at impact.
If your left shoulder drops too early during takeback,
your body ends up moving backward when you try to use power.
Imagine throwing a ball.
I'll throw the ball.
I naturally shift from your right foot to your left foot to throw it.
But if I start out
already on my left foot,
it’s hard to throw with power.
So i end up twisting backward
just to generate power.
That’s exactly what’s happening in your swing— your body collapses early during the takeback,
and then again in the opposite direction at impact, 반대쪽으로 무너지는 이런 것 때문에
causing fat shots and shanks.
When you set up at address,
your hips are already hinged and your spine
is tilted forward.
Even if you just rotate from that position,
your left shoulder will naturally lower.
But in your case,
it looks like you’re intentionally dropping your
left shoulder too early.
So when you take the
club back, try to keep the height
of your left shoulder the same.
Because your body is already tilted forward at address, your left shoulder
will still be lower than your
right when viewed from the side.
Try to keep your left shoulder from dropping until
the club passes your right foot.
But in your swing, your left shoulder drops
right from the start.
That early left side bend limits your rotation,
so you end up pulling the club back with your arms.
And when you don’t rotate your body enough,
your backswing starts to look small.
So it’s helpful to think:
"Keep your left shoulder height steady until the club passes your right foot."
Once it passes your right foot, your left shoulder can naturally drop,
and your hands can lift a bit more.
Then, during your follow-through, you tend to lean backward.
To fix that, imagine your left shoulder and
left leg moving toward
the target as you swing.
Sometimes, trying too hard
to keep your head
still or to stay
centered can cause your
body to move up and down instead.
So you should feel your body shifting to the right during the backswing and then back to the left as you swing through.
That means your weight should move from your left foot to your right during the backswing,
then shift back to your left foot during the
downswing for a proper swing motion.
Let me show you the best drill for this.
Try hitting balls while stepping.
Stand with your feet close together first.
As you step on your right foot, start your backswing.
You’ll notice your body naturally shifts to the right
without dropping the left shoulder.
As you step onto your right foot, let your body shift to the right, then step onto your left foot and swing through.
This is totally different from dropping and dropping again in place.
You can also start with your feet about shoulder-width apart.
From that setup, step onto your right foot during the backswing,
then step onto your left foot as you swing.
Now, let’s talk about another concern—
the angle of the club shaft when using an iron versus a driver.
When viewed from the side, they’re clearly different,
even though my body position stays the same.
With an iron,
If I make the same rotation, this is what it looks like with an iron.
Because the iron is set up at a steeper angle,
even if I rotate the same way, the club naturally goes back with the face pointing more toward the ground.
The driver is longer and sits more forward, so when you rotate, the takeaway tends to look a bit more like this.
You’ll notice the clubface opens a bit earlier than it does with an iron.
But most people build their swings based on what they see.
So even when they're holding a driver, they may think the clubface needs to stay square to the ball, like with an iron.
But if you think that way, your body won’t rotate properly.
You end up lifting the club back using mostly your hands and arms.
On the other hand,
if you understand that the driver’s
face can open up
more than the iron’s during the backswing,
you won’t feel the need to keep the face pointed toward the ball or the ground.
And if the clubface opens a bit, your body actually rotates better.
When you start the backswing
by pressing into your right foot, the face can open naturally.
If you move your body well,
but still try to keep the driver’s clubface looking at the ball or the ground like an iron during the backswing,
then you might end up making a cut shot as you come down into the downswing.
When that happens, you tend to lean back and flip at impact.
That’s what causes fat shots and shanks.
So understanding the difference between a driver and an iron is really important.
With a driver, it's okay for the face to open more.
With an iron, the face should look a bit more down compared to the driver.
Now, as I mentioned earlier,
try pressing into your right foot try pressing
into your right foot without dropping your left shoulder too early.
Then press into your left foot and swing through.
Move your body like this while keeping those key positions in mind.
First, try moving your body the way I showed you, and work on making your swing a bit bigger as well.
If you practice with that mindset and understand how driver and iron differ,
your swing will definitely improve.
Give it a try like this.
