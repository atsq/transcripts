The creator of the Hassan shot collar
says it is a shot collar with tape over
it. No, really. Now, this is not really
like I mean this this is just a picture.
Keep in mind this is literally just a
picture. Like I don't know whether this
is legitimate, valid, accurate, true,
authentic, real, etc. But uh it's
certainly a situation, right? And I'll
read it. Hi there. To me, it looks like
the uh the low to medium power RX090
receiver that comes with most of our
units out of the box. Uh you know, this
is the link to it right there. It looks
like someone cut the contact point, cut
off the contact points and put tape over
it to maybe cover up any rough edges
left for cutting uh instead of just
replacing the contact points with a
comfort pad. If you want to be sure
exactly what receiver it is, you need to
remove the tape. So now maybe that's
true, maybe it's not. I feel like in a
way, you know, things that are too good
to be true are sometimes not true. So I
it's hard for me really to believe that.
But like damn, that's crazy.
Yeah, it really is. Uh it's crazy.
Is this still a thing? Yeah, it is still
a thing, bro. It is still going on. It
is still a thing. People are still
thinking about it, talking about it,
getting into it. I mean, that's really
not a surprise. And check the email.
Yeah, but you just type whatever the
[ __ ] you want, right? I mean, that's
another incident
>> Trump was potentially going to use uh to
potentially put pressure.
>> Oh, damn, bro. Would you see she right
there? Were she not on the thing?
>> Trump was potentially going to use uh to
potentially put pressure on Jordan's
king to try and take in more
Palestinians. Correct. I mean, that's
what we've heard from Trump over the
course of the P.
>> Man, he does move his arm the same way
every time, man. He does. I mean, you
got to admit.
And he muted the mic. He did. He muted
the mic last few weeks is that he Jordan
and also Egypt
and so nobody even knows about this.
Trump was potentially going to use uh to
potentially put pressure on Jordan's
king to try and take in more
Palestinians. Correct? I mean, that's
what we heard from the course of the
past few weeks at the exact moment and
also Egypt.
>> I mean, it's really not I mean, I'm
going to be honest. It the release of
Kaya to the other side of the room has
been postponed indefinitely. A cease
movement, the most obvious one in my
opinion.
And it's just Wait, is this real?
Oh man.
Oh man.
Wow.
That's crazy. From the fridge to the TV,
Ka will be free. That's what they're
saying. That's what they're saying out
there on the streets, guys. Maybe they
should have Hassan do security for
TwitchCon next year. Maybe they should
have that.
Maybe that way. Maybe that way every
everything will be right in right place,
bro. Like
just bro like a cattle prod. Officer
Zapdos. There it is. Hassan called his
dog the spawn of Satan.
That [ __ ] right there. Okay, let
me tell you something. That [ __ ] this
this right here, this this [ __ ]
demon. Okay, who's sleeping like a
goddamn baby currently, that thing right
there was the spawn of Satan. Do you
understand me? When I'm telling you that
was the spawn of Satan, I'm telling you
like I was sick. I was sick to my
stomach. I was sick all the [ __ ]
time. I thought I was going to die.
It is crazy how much this dog has made
him mad.
Like, I've never seen a person make
another person as mad as I've seen Tan's
dog make Hassan.
[Music]
He gets so mad about this dog. Like, and
I know I a lot of this is probably
perform, you know, he's he's goofing
around, right? But like, there's a lot
of these other clips where I think he's
just mad like, man, he mad a lot about
this dog. Like, god damn.
>> He's probably,
>> look at her now.
>> Yeah.
>> The most perfect puppy of all time.
Why? Because I trained the living dog
[ __ ] out of her. Okay. You did? every
goddamn day. I had to train the people
around her to make sure that they were
doing the right things. I had to train
her every [ __ ] day.
And that's what you're supposed to do.
And look at her now. She's incredibly
well trained. But like the first Yeah,
the first
>> I love how well trained she's.
>> Look how good she is.
She doing great, guys.
She do whatever I wanted to
six months. I honestly I was like I'm
going to die. Like I I think I might
actually perish.
>> Damn.
>> If this continues.
>> Damn.
>> So just wait a minute.
Oh my god.
He's just allergic to the normal
Oh my god.
>> So,
>> you shipped her off to a puppy boarding
school. Yeah, but I trained her before
then.
>> It's another weird version of Dr. Pepp.
>> You have to remember she was very well
trained even before then and then after
that it was like it was over.
>> Plus, if I can do that, she can do that,
too. What are you talking about? This is
the [ __ ] governor. Like, what?
>> The governor? Who's Wait, what?
>> I sent her I trained the [ __ ] out of
her.
>> The governor for months. Who's the
governor?
>> I trained the [ __ ] out of her for months
and then I even took it to the next
level where I took her to professional
like doggy boarding school.
>> Uh-huh.
>> And after that she was it was over, you
know? She's just
the name of that school.
Um
I don't know, man. Like what do y'all
think? What do they name the lightning
gym in Pokemon?
What?
[Music]
Yeah.
I don't know. Thunder.
Oh man. Okay, so Jennifer. Oh god. This
is a This is probably one of the most
highlevel Karens in the country right
now. Holy [ __ ] We got to listen to her.
Jesus.
>> Okay. So, I I can say as somebody who
was at the house two weeks prior to this
incident, might even been 10 days prior.
>> So, I saw the collar when he tal it when
he took it off. There was no mechanism
or any sort of shocking thing.
>> This dog is spoiled rotten. This dog
adores Hassan. After we did the
streaming, the Twitch, we went out to
his like kitchen living area and she is
laid up on the sectional. A lot of
people don't let their animals on the
sofas, which I think is [ __ ] And um
that's something I've had it with people
that are like, "We don't let our pets on
the sofa." I'm like, "Well, then you
shouldn't have gotten a pet." Hassan's
dog has free rain. And then Marsh, who
is Hassan's producer, we had this little
like floral um uh halo type um you know,
like little flower girls, where I forget
what they're called. And we were putting
it on her. We were doing a photo shoot
with her. And then I brought it up to a
son again. I said, "You need to get a
bigger collar." And he goes, "Feel her
neck fur. Come here. Come here." And
she's just
>> I would. And then and he she is so her
hair is so thick that he had to put it
and it really wasn't even tight because
her hair is so freaking thick.
>> Then why'd you take it off?
>> But it bothered him that I thought that
maybe her collar was too tight. And so
we even had a follow-up conversation
about it. So when I saw the whole thing
about her, you know, like barking or
yelping or whatever,
that dog, she when we when I was on the
stream, I was on it for maybe like an
hour and a half. Yeah.
>> She had free reign of the entire room.
Like she came to me, she would have
crawled in my lap if I would have let
her. Then she laid down by the feet.
Then after that, we went and filmed a
podcast and she sat under the table of
the podcast. It's not like he forces her
to do things. And so I was so shocked
that number one
Ben Shapiro is using footage of me to
make some sort of [ __ ] case. But I
want to get into these Democrats like
leftleaningish
that are sabotaging this.
People just think that he's not that
deep. It's not that deep. Jennifer,
she got You got to relax. This is the
clip of her saying the the collar is too
tight. What the [ __ ] is she saying?
>> I think her collar is too tight.
>> Well, it's Are we
>> It's You have to You have to be able to
get two fingers and I couldn't even get
one. I think you're joking her.
>> She's like
It's a lot of neck meat.
She just
Oh man. How about that? That's exactly
it. Yeah. Uhhuh.
Oh man.
She got a lot of neck me. Yeah. I I
don't know. Like I mean it's just I
think people like this really whenever
she's talking about like defending him
because he's like on their side
politically. I think really if you segue
into that after you're defending them
like it's just not going to make anybody
except for people that you already like
I mean they're already in your orbit
that already agree with you, right? How
do you mean to say a collar was too
tight while actively trying to get
fingers through it? Yeah.
Jesus man. Oh my god. Why is this it
more pe Oh. Oh god. No.
It just Oh man.
Ka gets to be on the sofa. Case closed.
Guys is actually an amazing dog owner.
Yeah. Spoiled. I guess so. They're all
using the same word spoiled as Taylor
goes on blastly. I mean I don't know
what the [ __ ] right? I mean according
to Jennifer Welsh, I mean she is an
elite Karen. Like what do you expect,
bro? Like that's it. Of course she were
going to do this. And uh let's see if I
find it. Hassan Michael Vic. Yeah, I
mean maybe Michael Vic, he's a he's
another one, isn't he? And uh yeah,
that's it. Sound like he was about to
say it's a shot caller, it had to be on
tight. I mean honestly, if he had just
admitted at the beginning and I I don't
know. I mean I think honestly if he had
just admitted it I mean like Yeah, for
sure. And this is just Od Destiny
talking about this too. Of course. One
thing I
>> Isn't it crazy that this is still going
on? Like I really got to I've really got
to say this is impressive. Like this
this has dragged on for a bit. Like
we've been here for a while.
Oh my god. And he's finally playing a
good game. Thank god. One thing Assan
needs to do that he's not as good at um
although to be fair he doesn't have like
the whole apparatus backing like Trump
does is Han tries to play the same game
as Trump does. So when Trump makes a
when there's a lie that the Republicans
have to sell, every single Republican is
on board with the lie, right?
>> Oh, he's almost done.
>> He tried to do that with his um kind of
lefty squad. Now, I don't know if
>> But nobody trusts any of them. They
think they're retards. And then also the
other problem is that I think that
another big issue
is that a lot of these other people are
kind of like random ass people. Like
nobody gives a [ __ ] right? I mean, I
think Jennifer Welsh is kind of
wellknown. like I I think I think so.
I'm not really sure. But um a lot of
these other people like nobody really
knows them. And so it's hard to really
have that apparatus when it's only you
>> actually communicate with each other or
not.
>> See the the the Karen that we just got
done watching
>> over the lies. But the problem is you
can tell they're trying to do the same
kind of like model whether or not. But
they're not all on the same page. So the
lies are inconsistent. Right. You had
Cutie ended up admitting that it was a
shot collar, but the prongs were taped
over and it was taped off. And then you
had other people saying that it wasn't a
shot collar at all. Asan said he didn't
even wear the collar that day. So,
they're like they're trying to do the
same thing, but they their stories are
not cohesive.
>> It doesn't look too good, huh? Yeah.
And uh it's really sad, man. And uh it
is. And you're a big influence. It's
continuing. Well, I am, you have to keep
in mind, guys, uh I am the I am simply
the
the consumer.
I am the parasite.
And so if there is
flesh that is willing, that is able to
be prayed upon
in the form of videos or content, then
it will happen. That's it. I am the I am
I am a vampire. And so really if people
wanted me to stop doing it then they
should have let it die.
That's the reason why the warm god.
Yeah. That drama vampire I am. And the
more that this happens and the more that
this is something I think about, right?
But uh you know I I don't know. That's
what is come here for news. Yeah. This
is the big news of the day guys. This is
it. you should dress up as vampire for
your Halloween stream. Yeah, I can just
show up as myself. And uh so yeah, I
think that's probably true. They can't
they can't keep things straight. And he
just he Bro, he he really crashed out
over this. He got mad as [ __ ] bro. Like
he really did. Yeah, they've been
getting mad at each other a lot. Ka's
really spoiled sometimes. She gets to
drink water.
All right, let's go to the next one.
any of you dumb [ __ ] in this goddamn
chat. Oh my [ __ ] god. I hate I
hate the left. I hate liberalism. I hate
everything that's going on every single
[ __ ] day of the goddamn week. I just
I hate my life. I hate [ __ ]
streaming. I hate socialism. I hate
every single [ __ ] person who thinks
that the the peak of activism is just
being the most annoying holier thou
holier than thou. I also hate how this
stupid motherfucker's entire life, he's
the most nepo baby piece of [ __ ] in the
[ __ ] univer. The most spoiled rotten
[ __ ] Rich parents that came
from rich families that gave birth to a
rich little nepo son. And being rich
wasn't even enough. It wasn't even that
he was a rich spoiled little piece of
[ __ ] who just like had money his whole
life. Then he nepoed his way into
another industry that another family
member was established in. They had the
largest [ __ ] alternative left media
network. And then he neoed his way all
through [ __ ] Twitch through me. If
this guy had to deal with a an ounce of
adversity, his entire [ __ ] life, he
can't even handle a little bit of
[ __ ] balding without going on seven
different [ __ ] drugs for seven years
is unbelievable.
>> Jesus.
>> Which one?
>> He's got to do like a fraction of what
any ordinary human being or somebody
actually trying to climb their way
through success in this industry without
having a [ __ ] hand out from every
single part of the establishment doing
it. It's unbelievable.
>> The most ultimately woke leftist. It's
just it's You did it. You did it. You
have unlocked the [ __ ] nihilism
within me. Okay, I am
>> the nihilism is when I can't electrocute
my [ __ ] dog over and over and over
again to keep her in the corner of my
[ __ ] stream because I'm too [ __ ]
lazy to either have a house appropriate
for her where she's not going to walk
around and eat [ __ ] or because I just
want it to look good.
Bro,
bro, this [ __ ] is crazy.
Oh my god.
Let him cook. It's just so ridiculous,
bro. It really is. And uh so it is just
it to me it is so funny. It is so
[ __ ] funny for me to see this [ __ ]
It is hilarious.
And uh the left is cannibalizing itself.
It always will. It always will. That's
just the way it is, guys. That's life.
One more clip. Uh so clip playing
Destiny on LS. Okay, I I'll look at one
more. I'll look at one more.
>> He's on shotgate. Dr. Dr. K is on
Shotgate.
>> Yeah,
>> he's on Shockgate, bro. Oh my god. Okay,
it's too many. Dude, we've been through
like 20 different things if this dog.
>> Yeah,
>> I feel like at this point
>> the people who believe that he shocked
his dog aren't going to change their
mind.
>> You just learned that.
>> Didn't shock his dog, aren't going to
change his mind. literally just learned
that
>> of him [ __ ] pressing a button like a
big red button and like the shot caller
prong like close up into the dog's neck
>> like inserts electricity and the dog and
people be like see his dog and the other
guys be like well no that was just a
static shock and he was pressing a
random red button to change his OBS
scene you know like you know it doesn't
matter what you you know it's a
>> yeah this was the case ever since the
first day of it I'm going to be honest
it was this is This is It's been like
this for a while. Yeah, I mean for sure.
It's just
There sure are a lot of these, I'll tell
you that. And uh Quinn is the clown of
the internet. Well, hey, a lot of
gestures had a very important place in
courts. Okay, let me see if I can find
Oh, this is the uh the other one. Oh,
here we go.
>> There's a lot of pent up
stuff I think that's specifically
towards Hassan. So, I know for example,
>> let me let me go back. There's
there's a lot of pent up
there's a lot of pent up
stuff I think that's specifically
towards Hassan. So I know for example
that and I'm not saying this is true or
not true. I'm just saying that in the
with the creators that I've worked with
one
>> he talks like I do about this [ __ ]
>> Yeah. One of the things that
they're there are a handful of
communities that they're really scared
of and Hassans is one of them. I'm not
saying that that's justified or not
justified. I'm not saying it's true or
not true, but just
>> from
whatever reason, right? And when people
say I'll ask them like why, right? What
concerns you about? And I think it has
something to do with his size, his
rigidity, and the tribalism of his
community, right? There's like a there's
an us versus them.
>> Dr. K is completely right. I mean, like
it it's not even a question. I think
that he summed it up as well as anybody
could sum it up. He said it the way
anybody could say it. I mean, there it
is, right? I mean that I mean, he is a
doctor after all. Right. So, it makes
sense. I didn't know Dr. K is now an
alt-right Zionist neo-Nazi maga grifter.
Of course. And he hates women. Yeah,
definitely. Of course. And uh that's
what happens. Every big community uh
well, I don't know about every big
community except for mine, but yeah.
True. So true. Very true. So so so
