Does the 2021 Apex Utility Wood actually
hit the ball farther than the 2025 brand
new model? We think that might be the
case. Today, we're going to test the
2021 Callaway Apex Utility Wood against
the brand new, just released 2025 Apex
Utility Wood, and we kind of think this
one's going to perform a little better.
I'm joined by Tyler Fitzell, master club
fitter at Second Swing. And Tyler, when
this one was released back in the day,
it kind of surprised a lot of people. It
was explosive, a lot of ball speed, and
almost performed distance-wise like a
three-wood. Yep. And so now today, we've
got the brand new one two generations
later. Yeah.
Um what do you expect we're going to see
today?
Well, the first is I I think with the
way that they have added a little bit
more weight and they're trying to push
the envelope between um a hybrid and a
fairway wood.
I think we're going to still see some
explosive power there, too. Um they've
added a car carbon crown on the new
model to this,
but this right here has been one of the
favorites of so many um people that we
just keep flying off the shelf with this
thing. And so for them to have another
model come out that we get to go back
to. Um I think it's going to be a hit. I
think it's going to be a great test.
Yeah, because I remember I mean there
were players even taking three woods and
five woods out of the bag for this guy
right here in maybe the 17 or the 19
degree version of it. So today we've got
a 19 degree in both of the models here
and you're going to hit some shots for
us, Tyler. Yeah, you've got stock stiff
shafts with each one.
Um I think I'm going to go ahead and
predict I think the old one's actually
going to ter in terms of distance
actually going to be further. I don't
know about the other numbers, but I'm
going to say the 2021 model actually
goes farther.
I am going to try to make that happen.
So, it's not like I'm gonna try not to
make this happen, right? But I would
slightly agree with you. I have always
loved the look and for me, I love the
shape. Uh I think it's this perfect
combination.
Uh but we'll see whether or not
technology catches up and that's one of
the things we do every day.
You know, what's the new technology?
Let's put it to the test.
Let's do it.
So, Tyler, we'll start with the
original, the OG. Yes. The 2021 Apex
Utility Wood or UW.
Um, aside from all the explosive numbers
we just talked about that we initially
saw with this club,
I think another part that people loved
was the look of it.
Yeah, it's a classic. There's not a
whole lot going on on the crown there.
It's just a clean glossy black. And then
it's also a really good shape, too.
It is. I've played for a very, very,
very long time. People who know me know
that I've played an old Callaway hybrid,
a couple of them, for a long time. They
have a very similar shape. Also is kind
of this roundedness on both sides, a
little skinnier or slimmer through the
middle. This is a little bit bigger. Um,
but this is a shape that I've preferred.
And so that's one of the reasons I
stepped up and said, I'll I'll hit.
Yeah,
I'll hit because this just looks exactly
like the hybrids that I already have.
And the next step for me would be going
into one of these anyway, right? is when
I feel like that hybrid's not not going
to cut it for me in terms of what I'm
getting launch and spin. So,
sure. Yeah, I'm I'm intrigued by this
because
we've had a lot of, you know, people
comment and then fitters in general tell
us that this club is still
one of the best.
So, what were what would you Tyler be
sort of expecting, you know, numbers
wise? I don't Do you play a 19 degree
hybrid or is it more of a fairywood at
this spot in the bag for you?
So, I've got actually got an 18.
Okay. Okay. And and a 21
for hybrids.
Yeah. Okay.
And what I'm thinking about doing with
this is like for me the 18 is just
getting a little bit too low.
Okay.
So I think for me there's there's the
opportunity of going into this the
the 19
the 19. I think that'd be really good.
There we go. Couple dead straight ones
there. The last one had a little little
cut to it.
Yep. That's pretty much what I expect to
see out of it, though.
Yeah.
Um it it doesn't waver a whole lot.
That's one of the things I like is it's
just directionally I always kind of had
to hit it pretty straight. And then the
other part of it too is I'm looking for
something that carries around 200.
That is a little bit skinny.
Okay.
Talk to me about uh the feel of that one
and like sound and
Yeah.
how that feedback is.
It's got a little bit of a metal ping,
but it's quite crisp. Yeah, I think I
agree with that.
And so, uh, it's not necessarily
something where I look at it and think,
"Oh my gosh, this is it's too loud or
it's too soft, but depending on it's
really the metal face. You can kind of
really hear this."
Sure.
Is like that's what's giving it kind of
that crisp um metal sound to it.
Sure.
Um, it's one of the things that they
also we look back at the technology is
they had what I believe these are called
speed blades.
Yeah.
Um, was it speed blade?
Yeah. Well, they had the V steel too. It
might be a part of that. It might
there's it's similar to V steel, but I
don't think it's it's it's close. But
yeah, that was the year I think of the
like the velocity speed blades. Yeah.
Or that was the era there where they had
I think it was maybe the um
the Apex or the excuse me, the the Epic
series of drivers.
Let's go after a couple and just kind of
see what happens here.
That was a good ball right there.
Yeah.
Little extra height to that one, too.
Yeah. And that's just maybe, you know,
maybe not swing speed wise, but for me
it was just trying to stay in the moment
a little bit more and just swing. And
again, you know, 204 carry, this is
perfect for those those uh parfs that
you want to try to get about 200 yards
out of
a little off.
Yeah. Okay. Um, and then the other thing
that's really unique about this is for
for me is I've always liked the idea
that you not only have something that's
very hybrid like on this end of it, but
they've gone the other side. So, they
lengthened this out. Once they've
lengthened this out, you get a little
bit more um swing speed, you get a
little bit more ball speed, you can you
can get a little bit more launch and
spin.
This is really a fivewood, right? At 19
degrees, 18 19 degrees, this is really
just a fivewood. Yeah. And it's very
very close to kind of being that in
between five versus seven wood. But what
I also like is I when I get into a
fairway wood, it gets too long.
Yeah.
So now all of a sudden this I have to
kind of work on the swing to make sure
it it's getting through the zone. This
is just easier.
Yeah. I think it's a really good tweener
for player. There are a lot of players
that don't love the look of a hybrid.
Yeah.
Um but then you know maybe the fairwood
goes too high or something like that. It
launches too high with too much spin.
That's where this can be a really good
tweener.
That might have been the best one.
Oh, yeah. Look at that one.
And it was all right.
So,
excellent.
Yeah, we've got some numbers. Uh, let's
bring up. We'll go dispersion. We'll go
numbers. And we'll kind of identify too.
I know there was a couple you didn't
exactly.
Yeah, that's okay. You know, the ones
that were a little bit more weak on that
side.
We'll go carry here, too. That was what
you were trying to emphasize a little
bit, right? Was was that was that carry.
Um, I mean, I think obviously we've got,
you know, six pretty good balls out
there. I mean, you had a couple, this
one, maybe this one and this were slight
misses, but overall, if we look at all
six,
you were saying that you wanted to hit
this club on carry of 200 yards. We're
1.4 yards off from that.
Yeah.
Um, we have, you know, 147 smash factor
is pretty darn efficient. That's that's
hot for um anything that's not a driver,
right? Off the Yeah, it's not off the
That's good. I mean, that's great for
anything. Well, and this this is a this
is excellent especially when you start
talking about wind control.
Yeah.
Because of the launch, if you look at
that launch, 11 and a half's not a super
high launch to it, but it's also a
really good launch. Yeah.
It's like it it's kind of in that medium
zone.
Sure.
And then the other side of that too is
you get on maybe some of the par uh par
3s
where Yeah. you might be on a T um and
then you want to drop over to a you talk
about the mini drivers, they've kind of
taken over mini driver everything,
right? But like for long irons, I don't
put a long iron in my bag anymore. I'd
much rather have a hybrid just because I
can get more um stability with it.
Yeah.
So that's for me where I I start looking
at these as just long irons.
And now this is a really really beefed
up hybrid.
Yeah. It that's essentially what it's
kind of a a big brother to a hybrid.
Yeah.
Um I also wanted to note I I removed
your kind of I know there was one for
sure that you you right away made a
comment that it might have been thin.
Um, and uh, right away your average
carry goes to exactly 200 yards.
So, uh, that I mean, and these numbers
are are are pretty darn good, right? I
mean, when you hit the ball square, it
kind of turns over just a little bit and
you're carrying it over 200 yards. Y,
your slight misses are going a shade
under 200, but it's still it's not
damaging you too much there, right?
Um, you're still within that that close
range within what, eight yards, uh,
within that number. So, I like what I'm
seeing here. I'm so now before we I give
you the 2025 model, is there a
prediction that you have here? I mean,
this the shaft is slightly different,
stock stiff or both. Um, but is there a
prediction that you have here? Why you
kind of you're looking at that? You're
taking a peek at it. Um, we talked about
some of the technology that tungsten
sole plate and that added weight on kind
of on the sole right near the the face.
Um, what else are you seeing from that
and what do you maybe predict will
happen here? Well, I'm wondering if this
actually might be a little bit higher.
That's the what I'm looking at because
the carbon fiber top, which is now what
they've added in, at least on this
version of it as well, allows them for
more weights. They have more weight.
Now, both versions have what's known as
kind of this step, right? This
stepping pattern that allows for turf
interaction. And that's one of the
things that I I'm looking at is I'm on
turf here, so both of those should be
very similar to it. Um, and then they've
also added in what what they talk about
as their tungsten speed wave. Yeah.
Right. And that is try to stabilize this
a little bit more. So it looks almost
identical. It's very very difficult to
tell apart between the two.
And what I'm I'm interested is just
seeing all right well what has uh
essentially four to five years of
technology done.
Right. Right.
Yeah.
Yeah. because I think we've you've said
it before too on whether it's podcast or
or you know YouTube video is like year
to year a lot of times there's not a
huge change right now there has been one
model in partic or in between these two
yeah
but we're talking about four years now
and so
is there a huge jump in you know where
there's consistency maybe that's what
they're going for with the improvements
maybe it's pure distance I I again this
one went so far and was so explosive
originally that I just that was my
thought but maybe we'll see something
different here
from a lot of the people that I've
worked with um in the hitting bay on
clubs like this, they don't come out of
the bag.
Yeah.
Once these Yeah. If it's working well,
it's performing well, this is going to
stay in the bag a long time.
Yeah.
So, it's really going to be interesting
because I've played with the original UW
and I haven't played with this yet, but
I'm going to find out what it looks
like.
Maybe you will be playing with it.
Uh yeah. So, well, we'll give that a
shot and see what happens.
Way towy.
Okay.
Way towy. Very high. But
one thing I'm already I already noticed
and we'll see how it maybe it could have
been just the the slight miss that you
had there, but that sound was very
different. Higher pitched.
Yeah, that was very different. Well,
that I I would imagine is because of the
carbon, right? That's could create a
different internal sound.
Oh, yeah. That was much Yeah,
that was better.
Okay,
that was better.
148 on the smash factor there.
Yeah, I felt like I hit it pretty solid.
Not a uh at at least from the first few
hits, this is definitely a different
sound.
Oh, for sure.
Yeah, definitely.
Yeah. It's almost like there's like a a
whistle kind of that impact.
Yeah,
that was a better one there. You
surpassed that 200 carry mark there.
Yeah. 1.49. 49 on the smash factor. A
very efficient strike there.
That was good. I It felt good. That was
spinny.
I don't feel it.
So far, so far, again, we're we had a
couple shots left here, but so far, I
feel like that that pop that kind of
that that blew us away with the original
model.
Yeah.
Is not quite there. I feel like
And and I'm not sure about the little
tail off to the right.
That's right. And that could be part of
it, too. It's kind of almost like diving
right, which was not the case with the
original.
This looks
flatter.
Interesting. Okay.
Like right away when I set it down, it
looked flatter.
All right. I might I might try to see
what if they messed with the line angle
at all. I They would.
To to me is like I don't mind it not
going left. I don't That's not a bad
thing. I like that.
There. I felt like that was probably my
best swing at it, too.
Oh, yeah. Look at that shot. Okay. I
mean, I don't know what else you'd want
out of out of this club than that.
Dead straight.
I my first impression by looking at what
I've seen on some of the numbers is I
think this is spinning more.
Okay. I think this is because even even
on the um the original, you know, the
I think well I think the the what we're
going to run into is I think the spin
numbers might be pretty close, but I
think there was a couple misses that you
had
with this uh with the original that
might have spiked those spin numbers,
but I think your good swings. I think
you're right that this one is spinning
more.
Yeah, another good good poke there.
Okay,
so that one spun a little bit lower.
That was a little bit lower spin. Well,
and I don't know if that was out on the
toe or not. Let's take a look.
So, looking at dispersion, looking at
numbers, we've got basically this is
including every shot that we've hit.
Yeah,
that dispersion pattern is pretty
similar, right? Um, but we've got
a I mean, it's very very close across
the board here. Uh, and I think I first
want to highlight all the shots and then
we'll kind of highlight, you know, your
best ones, which I think for you are
kind of this pack of five right here. A
couple with the older, couple with the
newer.
Um,
you know, you see the club speed is very
similar, ball speed similar, smash
factor is the same. Interesting. The
launch was a little bit different
about a degree.
Yeah. So, and then we talked about spin.
It's actually the the newer model was
spinning a little lower
uh on average. And then the numbers
distance-wise are very close in terms of
that carry. So, but what I'm going to
do, let's kind of talk about these ones
here. So, we've got, see, this is where
you were referring to that lower spin.
So, these are the these are the the best
swings from the 2021 model.
Yeah.
We're in the 22. That one's at 32. This
is 25. Okay.
Yep.
And then now we're going to talk about
these two with the newer model. We're in
over 3,000. Over 3,000.
Yeah. So, I think there's a kind of a
different couple different ways to look
at this. As an average overall, all good
shots and bad shots included, things are
pretty close. Yep. And the spin um is
actually a little lower maybe on the m
hits with the newer model.
Yeah.
When you hit the ball good, hit it
solid, I think it's flipped where maybe
the spin is lower with the older model
and that could result in more distance.
Well, and I like I like this for a
couple of reasons. One of the things
that we continue to talk about are the
options that we're going to be getting
out of our fitting. If I'm looking for a
little bit more spin, I'm maybe looking
at the newer model
because what I need is I need some
stopping power with this too. If we're
looking at the dispersion gap from about
200 towards 226
or if you come back 200 versus 224 as
we're looking at it,
right? It's the stopping power. That's
the thing that I'm going to need out of
this is like generally speaking, it's
not just a blunt object that I need to
go as far like my driver. My driver is
just going to go as far as I possibly
can go.
Y
So, I'm going to need a little bit more
control with this. And um I think that's
a huge piece to this.
Um we'll have to look that up in terms
of the lie angle on it, but like from a
look perspective for me, I don't
necessarily prefer this look.
You like the older one
as much as the older one. Now, there's
some things about it, right? Like I
don't think it's any different here.
Yeah.
And I'm not so sure that it's it's a
whole lot different on top except for
the carbon fiber. Yeah.
Right. So I I don't have any clubs that
have this brake or this line. Everything
I've got is just gloss on the top from
fairway metal.
And um this I don't know. Would have to
just, you know, get used to it if this
this is a great option though.
So yeah, I I think those are all I mean
that's those are all things that matter
when it comes to you know you the player
or anybody watching this when they're
going to test a club. the look part
matters and obviously that's going to be
player dependent to a degree. Um I did
what I one thing I did kind of
manipulate here when you were discussing
that stuff was I did take out what you
know seemed to be the worst swing with
each right. Uh we're talking about a 189
carry with this and then down to 191
here.
Um and and things stay pretty similar.
You know we had about 200 carry which
again is really that's really funny to
me that you mentioned 200 carry right
off the bat and then we're kind of right
at that number with these clubs which I
think is worth noting. Both are really
hot off the club face. Um I I think what
I'm coming to the conclusion of here is
maybe the newer model is slightly more
forgiving. The misses were maybe a
little bit better. You can even see on
the dispersion there where these ones
off to the right. You did get more
distance out of those misses.
Correct.
Just based on the dispersion here.
Um
but I wonder if your good swings might
still be better with the older model. A
little bit more um distance potential
out of them with that lower spin rate.
So, it's going to be if you were put
making a decision like you had to put
one of these in the bag,
it's going to be kind of up to you which
you prefer that mishit performance maybe
with the newer model or maybe the max
potential of your good swings.
If I'm coming in and I'm saying I need a
club in this in this area because like
currently I have an 18 degree Callaway
hybrid.
Yeah,
it comes off just a little too low. It
doesn't hold very well. If I'm going to
come in and I'm looking at these as
options, it's going to be very, very
close. I'm also looking at this as a
long-term solution, right? If this is a
club that's going to work for me, I'm
probably going to get in 19. I'm
probably going to go with the one that
maybe does launch a little bit higher or
has a little bit more of that
forgiveness. We talk about all the time,
what is forgiveness?
Y,
it's essentially more ball speed on a
missit.
Yeah.
And if we've got more ball speed, we
have some better distances. I miss it
out to the right another 10 yards. 10
yards farther with a long club's a good
thing,
right? you know, 10 yards shorter on a
long club's not.
Yeah.
And also is if I'm hitting them really
well and they have some spin with some
stopping power, I'm higher, I'm farther,
it stops. This is the tool I think I
would go with the new one.
Sure. Yeah, I think that makes a lot of
sense. I mean, at the end of the day,
you know, with the slight slight maybe
advantage you'd have on these good
swings with the older model, Yeah. maybe
isn't quite worth the performance you
could save yourself on the mits with the
newer model, right? So, I think overall
we saw those improvements that are
supposed to happen with golf clubs over
those few years is the forgiveness
improves. The the performance that you
can save yourself when not hitting the
center in the face. We we saw it show up
today with the model that's four years
newer. So, u but golfers can try it out
for themselves. I mean, the Apex UW, the
whole Apex lineup, they've got utility
wood, super hybrids, utility irons. Um
come into a second swing store and try
them out for yourself. schedule a
fitting or you can connect with one of
our master fitters online as well and we
can help you get dialed in for one that
could help your bag. So, Tyler, thanks
for doing the testing. Um, this was a
great this was a great test here.
Love it.
