All right. If you want to drive a woman
absolutely wild in the bedroom and give
her the kind of pleasure she secretly
yearns for, then you need to know how to
touch her breasts just the right way.
And trust me, most guys don't. They
actually forget about the breast. So, in
this video, I'm going to go over seven
steps to touch, stimulate, and play with
her breast. So, you can give her some
unforgettable moments in the bedroom and
have her begging for more on a regular
basis. In fact, once you know these
seven moves, you'll never fail to blow a
woman's mind in the bedroom. So, pay
attention, keep watching, and get ready
to squeeze. Just kidding.

steps to touch and stimulate a woman's
breast. Number one, the slow buildup.
Most guys go straight for the breasts
the second they start touching a woman,
and that's a huge mistake. They go kiss,
boob. Women's breasts are incredibly
sensitive, and their arousal builds
gradually. If you rush, you kill the
magic. So start by touching around her
breasts, these areas, her rib cage, even
the outside curves of her chest. Then
slowly
get closer, letting your fingers brush
over her skin like you're teasing her.
When you finally touch her breasts, that
anticipation you've built will make it
10 times more intense and more
pleasurable. So just think of it as
warming her up. Her nipples will become
more sensitive, and from then on, she'll
crave every touch you give. Okay. Number
two, the feather light tease. One of the
most erotic ways to play with her breast
isn't squeezing or grabbing. It's
teasing with the lightest touch
possible. Just use your fingertips or
even the back of your fingers and slowly
circle her breast without going straight
for the nipple. This barely there touch
wakes up all the nerve endings and
builds sexual tension like crazy. You
can even blow warm air or lightly kiss
along her chest to amplify the
sensation. This technique works because
women's skin is packed with sensory
receptors and the contrast between
gentle teasing and deep pressure will
drive her wild. I would really love if
you could see a video of this tactic
because doing it just the right way is
essential, which is why I'm so excited

right, number three, compliments. Next,
I want you to compliment and appreciate
her breasts. You are so pretty.
Tell her how beautiful, how soft, and
how sexy they are. Tell her how much you
love them, how good they feel in your
hands, how like luscious they are. The
vast majority of women are extremely
self-conscious about their breasts,
whether it's the size, it's the shape,
their nipples. This self-consciousness
can kill her ability to let go and enjoy
the moment. So, make sure you let her
know how much you adore her breasts.
Doing this step is key to having her
relax into the moment, take in all the
pleasure, and get her on the way to the
most amazing mindmelting experience.
Number four, the tongue spiral. Your
mouth is the most powerful tool when it
comes to breath play. But instead of
just sucking on the nipple right away,
start by using your tongue to draw slow
circles around the areola. Just like
what you're doing with your fingers,
gradually spiral inward and then when
you reach the nipple, flick it with your
tongue. The spiral movement builds
anticipation and heightens sensitivity.
And once she's turned on, you can
alternate between soft sucking and
flicking with your tongue. The
combination of your tongue's wetness,
warmth, and rhythm will send intense
waves of pleasure through her body,
sometimes even sparking full body
shivers. It's amazing. Number five, the
pinch and release. Once she's really
aroused, a little pressure on her
nipples can feel incredibly intense,
almost electric. That's when you can try
this move. Not before. Lightly pinch her
nipples between your fingers. Then
release and switch to gentle rubbing or
rolling. You don't want to be rough
unless she specifically likes that. But
a soft pinch paired with a gentle tug
can shoot currents of pleasure straight
down to her core. The secret here is
variation. Mix in sucking, licking, and
rubbing so she never knows what's coming
next. That unpredictability keeps her
body on the edge in the best possible
way. Number six, sucking in rhythm.
Sucking on her nipples is the most
obvious way to pleasure her breasts. But
the secret most guys miss is the rhythm.
The rhythm. Once turned on, women
respond to steady, repeated motions that
build intensity. So, start with a soft,
slow suck, then gradually increase
pressure and speed like you're building
a beat that she can melt into. Add in a
gentle flick of your tongue while you
suck it, and it becomes almost
overwhelming in the best way. For many
women, this rhythm can actually trigger
breast orgasms because it mimics the way
arousal builds in other parts of her
body. And the pleasure is off the
charts. And you can practice on your arm
too to just feel what it feels like.
Number seven, the hand mouth combo. Your
hands and mouth working together is like
a game changer. While your mouth focuses
on one nipple, using your hand to
massage and stimulate the other breast.
This double stimulation creates a flood
of pleasure because her brain is getting
signals from multiple places at once.
You can gently squeeze her breast, roll
her nipple between your fingers, or
lightly scratch the underside while your
tongue and lips are busy with the other
breast. The result is I can't even
explain, but she feels overwhelmed in
the best way. Her body starts to arch
and respond involuntarily. Like I said,
this is a game changer. It's like
hitting her on all sides. But remember,
it's not something you want to rush
into. You want to get her as turned on
as possible before you give her the
handmouth combo. Plus, it's hard, you
know, for you to do sometimes, too.
Again, practice on your arm. That's what
creates maximum pleasure and often leads
to deep mindmelting orgasms. That said,
now you know how to touch and stimulate
a woman's breasts the right way.
