If you're shopping for a top-of-the-line
golf watch, chances are the Garmin
Approach S70 is already on your radar.
It's the one everyone talks about, and
to be fair, it's the one to beat. But
here's the twist. The new Garmin Venu X1
shares almost all the same golf
features. And on top of that, it comes
with smarter everyday tools that feel
closer to something like an Apple Watch
Ultra. Now, it's not perfect, and that's
why I spent £680
to test it both on and off the course.
In this video, I'll show you exactly
where the VU X1 matches the S70, where
it outshines it, and where it falls
short. Tap the like button if this video
helps you out, and let's dive in. So,
what exactly is the VU X1? Think of it
as Garmin's answer to the Apple Watch
Ultra. It combines serious health and
fitness tracking with full smartwatch
features. This model is bigger and
bolder than any VU before it. And in
fact, it has Gin's largest ever screen.
Also has a slim design and has a fully
packed feature list under the hood. The
OLED screen looks fantastic, but it's
massive. In fact, let's just grab a
Garmin S50 for comparison. And just look
at the size difference of these two
screens. On my little 6in wrists, this
watch is simply too big for me. It looks
like I've strapped an iPad to my wrist.
But for those of you with average or
larger size wrists, not like my
teenytiny ones, this large screen and
design could actually be a positive for
you. When it comes to fitness tracking,
it's got almost everything covered.
Unless you're really into scuba diving
and want a smartwatch that can handle
that, you're going to be absolutely fine
with this watch. But the real difference
between this watch and the Garmin
Approach S70, aside from this giant
screen and nylon strap and its thin
design, is actually the smartwatch
features. Now, with the X1, you can
answer calls directly from your wrist.
The speaker and the mic included in this
watch are pretty solid. You can
comfortably hold a conversation on the
watch, and you can use the microphone to
access certain features on the watch,
such as starting a stopwatch or
something like that. But what's more
important is that you can actually
trigger your smartphone's voice
assistant. So, if you've got an iPhone,
you can talk to Siri just as you would
with an Apple Watch or your iPhone. Now,
that's something that even the S70 and
even the Fenix 8 can't do. It's not
seamless and as convenient as using an
Apple Watch, but it's still pretty handy
to have. And then there's the built-in
LED light. Now, whether you have it the
white or the red, I really like having
an actual LED built into my watch. It's
much better than just lighting up the
screen and calling that a torch. I found
it genuinely useful when reading my
son's bedtime stories. We're currently
reading some god awful Minecraft
fanfiction. What was wrong with the
Hobbit? I think we're going to have to
bring back the classics. But here's
where some of the drawbacks start with
this watch. First of all, for nearly
£700, you only get this nylon strap out
of the box. It's fine. It's comfy, but
I'd rather be wearing something with a
rubber strap instead, or at least have
the option to wear a rubber strap
included in the price. And of course,
while this watch is certainly much
closer to an Apple Watch, or really an
Apple Watch Ultra, it's still not as
smart as one, and the user interface and
general interactions if you use an
iPhone just aren't as seamless as if you
actually use an Apple Watch. If you've

the people that watch my videos are

it makes a huge difference, especially
when I have to buy the majority of the
pieces of equipment that I review for

let's get to the most important part of
this video that you probably care about
the most. How does this watch actually
perform out on the golf course as a golf
watch? The good news, the Venu X1 is an
excellent golf watch. It matches the S70
pretty much feature for feature. It has
more than 40,000 courses pre-downloaded
onto the watch. It shows you the front,
middle, and back yardages, and it has
the full homemap display on the right
hand side of the screen. And it looks
gorgeous with this giant OLED display.
The watch also has the playslike
adjustments which factor in slope and
wind and environment conditions. And it
also has the pinpointer feature, shot
tracking, and it even has the virtual
caddy mode if you want to use that, too.
And with such a big screen, everything
is just easier to see. The yardages, the
menus, the scorecards, there's no
squinting, there's no crowding. And if
your eyesight isn't that great, you can
even bump up the font size for the whole
watch. Or you can even turn on the
dedicated big numbers mode for golf.
Now, navigating this watch is nice and
smooth cuz this watch combines a
touchcreen which is really responsive as
well as having the select and back
physical buttons on the side. But this
watch isn't identical when it comes to
the golf features of the S70 as that
watch has dualband GPS. Now, the Venu X1
like the smaller S70, the S50 and the
S44 only has single band GPS. Now, most
of the time that's absolutely fine, but
under trees or around buildings, the
dual band in the larger S70 may track
more accurately. And one thing I have
found with the X1 is that at the moment
there's a bug. When you finish a hole,
the watch pops up and suggests what it
thinks was your score and your stats.
Now, normally you just confirm or press
the edit button if it's not got
something quite right. But for some
reason, sometimes the X1 won't let you
press the edit button. You have to
accept the incorrect information and
then go back and edit it in the
scorecard menu afterwards. Now, this is
a pretty small problem, but at this
price, it's quite annoying, and it
raises a bigger question. Because the X1
isn't a dedicated golf watch, will
Garmin keep refining the golf features
as tightly as it does for the S70. From
my testing, this watch is very good on
the course. But I do have that little
doubt that lingers that this isn't a
dedicated golf watch, despite the fact
that it does everything that a dedicated
golf watch does do. Now, I want to take
a moment to talk about the battery life
of the X1 because it's a compromise that
really hits quite hard. Owners of Garmin
watches are usually really smug about
the battery life. And to be honest,
that's fair enough. The Approach F70
would give me around 10 to 14 days
between charges when I was using it just
every day off of the course. The Garmin
X1 gives me about 6 days, and that's
with the always on display turned off.
If you want the always on display turned
on, then that's going to drop closer to
around 2 to 3 days. Now, yes, this is
more of a smartwatch, which means that
the battery is going to be drained by
those features, but it means that you're
going to be charging this battery a lot
more often. Away from golf, this watch
is stacked with health and fitness
tracking features. Sleep, stress, HRV,
V2 max, training readiness, body
battery, the list goes on. And that data
can be surprisingly useful and accurate.
When I'd had a few bad nights sleep in a
row, the watch flagged that my training
readiness was only at moderate and
suggested that I actually take it easy
rather than do any significant training.
Now, I don't need a watch to tell me
that I'm exhausted, but it was accurate
and serves as a helpful reminder that
maybe I shouldn't be pushing it too
hard. One potentially significant
limitation is that while this has
Garmin's Gen 5 heart rate sensor and
blood monitors, it doesn't have an ECG
monitor. Now, the Gin S70 doesn't have
an ECG monitor either, but an Apple
Watch does, and so does an Apple Watch
Ultra and even a Fenix 8. So, if that's
important to you, then the X1 isn't
going to cut it. For workouts, I found
this watch to be fantastic. It supports
downloaded GPS maps for walks, runs, and
cycling. Something that the S70 doesn't
actually do, at least not out the box.
You've got to then add the maps in, and
I never even tried that. With this one,
it just worked out the box. And as
always with Garmin, syncing to the app
on your phone is seamless. Something
that does frustrate me with pretty much
all Garmin watches, and it's the same
for this one, is that Garmin Pay is a
great idea. But here in the UK, there
aren't that many mainstream banks signed
up to it. So using it isn't as seamless
as it really could be. Certainly not as
good as using the contactless payment on
an Apple Watch. And one thing that I
always like to point out when it comes
to smart watches like this is that if
you love wearing a mechanical watch like
I do, you might find it a bit of a
struggle to fit a smartwatch into your
rotation as you really do need to be
wearing the watch all the time to get
the most out of the features that you're
paying for. And after testing the X1 for
around a month, I really miss wearing my
mechanical watches. So here's the bottom
line. The Garmin Venu X1 is a real
alternative to the S70, but it's not a
straightforward choice. If you value
golf performance and having a watch with
a long battery life, the S70 still wins
in my opinion. If you want smarter
features, such as being able to take
calls and use your phone's voice
assistant and having an actual light in
the watch, and you don't mind charging
it more often, then the X1 is probably
worth considering. even at £180 more.
And if you want the best of both worlds,
then maybe the Fenix 8 is the one to
look at instead. But now you're spending
nearly £900 and you're still missing a
couple of the features that the X1 has.
