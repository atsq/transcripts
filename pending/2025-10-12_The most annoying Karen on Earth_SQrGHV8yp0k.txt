There was this woman, she's been getting
a lot of publicity recently for being an
annoying, fat, [ __ ] [ __ ] This is
the one that started it all.
So, Katie Porter, someone who used to
work with her, said, sent me this clip
from a train wreck interview with her
and said, "Now, imagine what she's like
when there aren't any cameras around."
>> What do you say to the 40% of California
voters who you'll need in order to win
um who voted for Trump?
How would I need them in order to win,
man?
>> Well, unless you think you're going to
get 60% of the vote. You think they get
60%? All everybody who did not vote for
Trump will vote for you. That's what
what you're saying
>> in a general election. Yes. If it is me
versus a Republican, I think that I will
win the people who did not vote for
Trump.
>> What if it's you versus another
Democrat?
>> I don't intend that to be the case.
>> Well, that's convenient.
>> So, how do you not intend that to be the
case? Do you are you going to ask them
not to run?
>> No. No. I'm saying I'm going to build
the support. I have the support already
in terms of name recognition. And so I'm
going to do the very best I can to make
sure that we get through this primary in
a really strong position. But let me be
clear with you. I represented Orange
County. I represented a purple area. I
have stood on my own two feet and won
Republican votes before. That's not
something every candidate in this race
can say. If you're from a deep blue
area, if you're from LA or you're from
Oakland, you haven't you don't have an
experience.
>> But you just said you don't need those
Trump voters.
>> Well, you asked me if I needed them to
win. So you don't
>> I feel like this is unnecessarily
argumentative. What is your
>> You see her getting mad, bro. Getting
her hands up, everything like this. Can
you imagine having to deal with somebody
like this? Oh my god. This is like an
elite Karen raid boss
>> question. The the question is the same
thing I asked everybody that this is
being called the empowering voters to
stop Trump's power grab. Every other
candidate has answered this question.
This is not
>> I said I support it. So, and the
question is, what do you say to the 40%
of voters who voted for Trump?
>> Oh, I'm happy to say that. It's the do
you need them to win part that I don't
understand.
>> So, why not just say tell them the [ __ ]
off? Like, you can clearly see that
she's avoiding the question because her
real answer to it is [ __ ] them. I don't
care about them, but she doesn't want to
say that because it sounds bad. But the
problem is that people like this are so
obnoxious and so annoying that anything
they do sounds bad because they're just
this is just what they do. And I'm happy
to answer the answer the question as you
have it written and I'll answer it.
>> And she about to call the manager. Do
>> you think you need any of those 40% of
California voters to win and you're
saying no, you don't?
>> No, I'm saying I'm going to try to win
every vote I can. And what I'm saying to
you is that
>> Well, to those voters,
>> you know, you know, you're getting
wrapped up.
>> Okay. So,
>> I mean, this is my opinion. It's like if
you get flustered and upset like this on
an interview, but you can't even answer
a simple question like this, like you do
not need to be running anything.
>> You
>> I don't want to keep doing this. I'm
going to call it.
>> Uhoh. Uh-oh. She's mad.
>> You're not going to do the interview
with us.
>> Nope. Not like this. I'm not. Not with
seven follow-ups to every single
question.
>> It's actually only one followup, but you
just can't answer it. It's really just
one.
Every other candidate has answer
>> I don't care. I I want to have a
pleasant positive conversation which you
ask me about every issue on this list
and if every question you're
>> everybody I want to have a an interview
where you ask me about how right I am
about these different topics and I want
to like how do you say that you want a
positive interview
like that this this isn't your [ __ ]
this isn't your campaign staff this is
the news they need to ask you questions
it's not supposed to be positive or
negative
Karen logic. It is. It's Karen logic. It
is. Absolutely.
>> Make up a follow-up question. Then we're
never going to get there.
>> Yeah.
>> And we're just going to circle around.
>> I have never had to do this before.
Ever.
>> That's the problem. That's the problem
is you should have been doing this all
along so we could have filtered your
stupid ass out years ago. But for some
reason, people put up with your
aggressive, patronizing care and logic
and behavior, and now you're here.
>> You've never had to have a conversation
with
>> to end.
>> Okay. But every other candidate has done
this.
>> I What part of I'm me. I'm running for
governor.
>> I'm me. What part of I No, I'm special.
I don't have to answer questions. No,
>> I'm a leader. So Wait, what?
>> Partard of I'm me. I'm running for
governor cuz I'm a leader. So,
>> what are you leading? Golden Corral. The
[ __ ] are you talking about?
>> I am going to make
>> So, you're not going to answer questions
from reporters? Okay, why don't we go
through? I will continue to ask
follow-up questions because that's
>> that's what leaders do is they don't
answer questions from reporters because
they're afraid of it. No, this is very,
very reassuring. Definitely, guys. That
exact attitude is how Camala lost,
except this [ __ ] has a way worse. She's
so obnoxious, isn't she? Oh my god,
there's more of them, too.
>> Bob is a journalist, but I will go
through and ask these. And if you don't
want to answer, you don't want to
answer. So, nearly every legislative
>> I am I don't want to have an unhappy
experience with you. And I don't want
>> this woman would have made a great queen
in like a medieval age that sentences
servants to like death for like the
servant brings her water and the water
isn't cold enough and she like just
decides that he's going to get killed. I
think you you really like this woman was
born a thousand years too late in like
the you know middle ages times around
there like she could have made a great
tyrannical ruler like a psychopathic
[ __ ] killing everybody who disagrees
with you ruler like yeah this is great
and I yeah Katie Katie Antonet yeah I
guess so right
>> this all on camera I don't want to have
an unhappy experience with you either I
would love to continue to ask these
questions so that we can show our
viewers.
>> Nobody wants to have an unhappy
experience
>> feels about every one of these issues
that they care about and redistricting.
It's a massive issue. We're going to do
an entire story just
>> Yeah. just about this. And so anyway, so
she's been going hog wild. Scalded
ex-husbands. Okay. Hey. Uh, Katie Porter
would pour scalding hot mashed potatoes
on your head if you're not
I would have never assumed. Honestly,
this this is a big surprise to me. I
would have never expected her to waste
food. Big Rep. Rep. Katie Porter scalded
ex-husband's scalp with potatoes.
document show the former husband former
that poor man uh of of representative
Katie Porter uh said and yeah back in
the old days that would have been
boiling hot burning oil. Okay. So,
remember what I said? It's becoming more
and more true. And uh anyway, uh Katie
Porter said that he uh said that the
California Democrat frequently abused
him verbally and threw toys, books, and
other objects at him during their
marriage.
Can you believe that?
>> Can you believe Wow.
I That's crazy.
I I instantly believe it. And you just
look at her, you know, it's true.
She spent three I see her for three
minutes. I know this [ __ ] is crazy.
Can you imagine this? You should have
Yeah, bro. Did she She actually is
making a mistake. This isn't the you you
should be running for uh governor of the
homeowners association. Not Not the Not
the city or the the state. No, that this
she should be running for everve of
homeowners association. That's her job.
That that's what she's meant to do. Even
pouring scalding hot mashed potatoes on
his head during a fight. According to
divorce reports, Matthew Hoffman, who
filed for divorce from Porter in 2013,
said in a request for a restraining
order,
dated April 30th of that year that he
was routinely called a [ __ ] idiot and
[ __ ] incompetent by his ragrone
spouse. Ra, more like ragrone crone. uh
who also shattered a glass coffee pot on
their kitchen counter in March 2012 when
she felt that their house wasn't clean
enough.
Oh my god. At least Yes, bro. He got
away.
He got away from it. That's crazy. Yes.
And so, let's go back. We're going to
watch some of these other clips about
it, too. And uh let's see if I can find
it. Katie P. And you can see obviously
it's just totally going down here. and
she was actually winning. Isn't that
sad? That's scary, isn't it? And uh Oh,
here's another one. Okay, let's see if I
can find any more of this here. She
rudely inter interrupt this interview.
Oh, this is Gavin Newsome being an
[ __ ] Yeah, California's really got a
lot of winners in it. Okay, so let's go
over. We're going to watch another one.
And this is her also in her house. This
is I guess during COVID.
>> We did a study recently this fall in
September. And what it showed is if we
don't um electrify our transportation
sector that we're going to lose more
than half a million Californians dying
prematurely to air pollution and other
problems and the state could lose
Get out of my [ __ ] shot. I wanted to
tell you that.
Yeah. Somebody's got to get this. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Somebody maybe give her a
shot caller for her uh her assistance.
Damn, bro.
>> You're out of my [ __ ] shot. I wanted
to tell you that that's actually
incorrect. It's not that it's electric
vehicles. It's that if we don't make the
commitments climate.
>> Okay. It does. Okay. You also were in my
shop before that.
Stay out of my shot.
>> She going hog wild.
>> I'm going to start again with electric
vehicles saving us money.
>> How do you let this get Oh my god. Like
really? I I watch this. [ __ ] no. We
don't want to deal with this [ __ ] Oh
my god.
the Empress. Yes, exactly. Just imagine,
have you ever been around a person like
this? Because if you have, you know this
is real. How's she not embarrassed?
Because she's used to getting her way
because she's obnoxious, belligerent,
aggressive, and hostile. And most people
just give her what she wants so she will
go away. That's the reason why this is
the kind of person it's like you give
her, you're like, "You know what? You
want it for free because I messed up
your order. You're going to get it for
free. Please. Okay. Now, please leave.
We're going to give it to you for free.
And then she leaves thinking that she's
a great negotiator.
The gigaaren. Yes. This is the final
boss right here. Is this a 2enter? Oh,
you know. And then, oh, it gets better.
Video resurfaces of Democratic goober
national candidate Katie Porter showing
up to work in Washington DC in a Batgirl
costume. That's right, guys. It gets
better. Porter wore the outfit on the
same day the Democrats voted for a
resolution on ground rules for
impeaching Trump back in 2019.
That's right.
>> Congressman Porter,
>> does Alfred get minimum wage?
If you if you return the Batmobile,
could you could you pay for the Green
New Deal?
>> Oh [ __ ] man. What is this? Yeah. Yeah.
What is this? She wishes for Yes.
>> This is
>> Does Alfred get
>> Oh my god.
There we go, guys. God to your trolling,
I guess. So, this is what people voted
for. Well, I mean, California is a very
interesting place with a number of very
complex people in it. Uh, nobody knows
exactly why or how it's gotten this way,
but we know that it is this way. I don't
know why they forgot the cow print.
Yeah, the Yeah, the cow print outfit I
guess was uh uh it was it was taken.
>> If you if you return the Batmobile,
could you could you pay for the Green
New Deal?
>> Comes from a quarter.
>> Return the Batmobile. Can you pay for
the Green New Deal? Okay, so there you
go. Right here. And then she drops her
drink and you can see her malding out
over this, right? And uh yeah, why is
she wearing this? I don't know why. Why
would somebody do this?
This is So this right here, gentlemen,
this is the This is one of the leading
Democrat candidates right here.
This is it.
Hog Logic, you could guess so. Yeah,
because the vote. Yeah. And uh is is
that Halib Berry? No, it's not. I can
see why you'd get confused, though.
Probably talk to your doctor about
glasses, though. And uh no, no way she's
gonna be governor of my state. I I I
can't even believe this. This is insane.
And there's even more of it, too. It's
not like this. You think this is the end
of it? It's not the end of this is the
Karen. Yes, this is the last boss of all
Karens after every other Karen has been
defeated.
She would just be there. The last the
last one standing.
Oh god. And uh let's see here. Halloween
or Yeah. Karen Antuinette. Yeah, I know.
And so here here you go again.
And
>> Oh, yes. This is why I didn't want to do
I need the lights off. The bright
lights. I'm so sorry, but I am about to
get on Bernard. I need you to turn these
off.
>> Lights off.
>> These that are killing me.
>> Hang on one second, everybody.
>> Yeah, we should put the computer up on.
>> Yes. Yes, we should have. Yes. Okay,
everybody. I'm not that dark.
Uh
>> oh. Uh oh.
Somebody's about to get Yep.
Somebody's about to get executed.
>> Sorry.
>> And now
just a minute.
>> Comes back. All the [ __ ] assistants
are dead.
Blood over. Okay. All right. Now we're
fine. Anyway, so we need to have more
empathy in this country and we need to
start thinking more about
blood everywhere. Yeah.
So Trump's a psychopath.
There's mashed potatoes everywhere.
Yeah. And guarante guaranteed her
staffers do this to [ __ ] with her.
You're right. I bet they're doing it
wrong on purpose. They're like, "Oh,
sorry, Katie. Did I turn the light on
again? Oops."
>> Okay, everybody. I'm sorry about that.
>> Did you see that?
>> I'm sorry about that.
>> God damn.
She got to get the shot callers for
everybody. She was afraid, bro. She's
terrified.
>> I am in a TV studio um getting ready to
go on Quomo and so I had all those
studio lights on me and I couldn't see
myself or see you guys.
>> Yeah. Yeah, for sure. Definitely. Well,
why not just sit at the [ __ ] studio
desk, you [ __ ]
You're sitting there with You're using a
webcam uh from your laptop. That's
obviously what you're doing. Just go sit
in the [ __ ] studio.
You [ __ ] [ __ ] Like you can't you
really can't Oh, I wait a minute.
There's stairs.
You have to go up the stairs to the
studio or to to the to the set.
Yeah, cuz you can see how it's it's
raised.
So, yeah, you weren't able to do that.
Yeah, I think so. So, yeah, it's like
climbing a mountain.
Can you believe it's a mountain climbing
a mountain? Anyway, so uh where's a few
more of these here? Exactly. It's not
hard to believe. Yes. These are the
types of women everywhere. Mommy,
dearest vibe. Yes. And so and and look
at all of these other clips.
Oh, here we go. Let's listen to her
here.
you know, this allegation of groomer and
pedophile. It is alleging that a person
is criminal somehow and engaged in
criminal acts merely because of of their
identity. Um,
>> so this [ __ ] hog wants to say that
pedophiles aren't criminals.
Am I getting this right?
I can't even believe this.
their sexual orientation, their gender
identity. You know, this allegation of
groomer and pedophile, it is alleging
that a person is criminal somehow.
>> Oh my god.
>> Engaged in criminal acts merely because
of of their identity, um their sexual
orientation, their gender identity.
>> Yeah. I don't know, guys. That's a lot.
She's addressing her family secrets.
Yes. Check if she has kids or not. I
mean, those poor kids. I don't know.
Maybe that's not it. It certainly sounds
[ __ ] weird, man. And uh yeah, she's
the one recording this, so this isn't
even the worst side of her. Yeah, I
guess so. Uh like at this point, Asma
attacker, as I told you, supporter.
Yeah, this is nuts, man. Like it's it's
ridiculous. Maybe this is maybe this is
cut in a weird way, but I mean all these
other clips put together. I mean, guys,
this is not looking good at all. This is
looking real bad. And then so you got
this one. Oh, here we go. This couldn't
She couldn't get more unlikable. All
right, let's watch it. Here we go. I'm
running for governor because I'm a
leader.
>> Could lose.
Get out of my shot.
>> Cuz I'm a leader.
>> I need you to turn these off.
>> That are killing me.
>> Yes. Yes. We should have. Yes. Okay,
everybody. I'm not that dark.
>> Run for governor because I'm a leader.
>> You know this allegation of groomer and
pedophile. It is alleging that a person
is criminal somehow
>> and engaged in criminal acts.
>> Okay. Okay, maybe she was saying that
calling somebody trans means that
they're a pedophile and that pedophiles
are criminals. Okay, maybe maybe she's
not that [ __ ]
She's just a psycho
>> because of maybe maybe
>> identity um their sexual I think that's
right a leader. So on election night I
was with I went to pick up my daughter
from water polo party.
>> That poor girl. What did you do to her?
ice and she's 12 and she got in the car
and she was crying.
>> Yeah,
I bet.
>> And I said, "Did someone punch you?"
Like water pol is a rough sport. I was
like, "Did someone hit you? Did the
coach yell at you? What happened?" And
she said, "Mom, Trump won. Trump's going
to win. And what if I get raped and I
need to have an abortion?"
>> Oh my god.
This is from a 12year-old.
>> What the [ __ ] is going on?
>> I'm running for governor cuz I'm a
leader. I don't want to keep doing this.
I'm going to call it.
>> Oh my god. Let me see if there's any
more of this, too. This is nuts.
She looks like Piers Morgan in a wig.
Yeah, I I maybe
Katie Porter meltdown. Katie Porter
Batman.
Oh my god, look at this. Are there any
more of these here too?
And let's see here. She's treated staff
like garbage. Yeah, sure. I cannot allow
you back into the office given your
failure to to follow office policies. Oh
jeez, that's a lot. And uh well, you
gave me COVID. Oh, she said that she Oh,
man. She thinks somebody gave her COVID.
Uh CNN is hiding it. And I think that
Katie Porter is making history because
she has potentially annihilated her
chances to be the next governor of
California, more so than any other
candidate I've ever seen so quickly. My
goodness gracious. What are we talking
about right here? Well, let's take a
look. Chance to be the next California
governor. According to the Cali
prediction market, Katie Porter's
chances have fallen through the floor.
Just two days ago, she was the plurality
leader in the prediction markets at 40%.
Now, get this. Her chance has fallen by
more than half to just 16%. My goodness
gracious. Meanwhile, Alex
>> Padilla isn't even running. Wait, so the
so she's losing to a guy that's not even
running.
>> Who's not even running for governor of
California at this point? He's a sitting
senator from that state. His chances
have gone up through the roof from 10%
all the way to 27% nearly gone up
threefold. Now, one of the big reasons
why the prediction markets have lost so
much on Katie Porter's chances to be the
next governor,
is because people are really interested
in this story. Take a look here. Google
search for Katie Porter at an all-time
high despite Katie Porter having a long
political career. Get this, up over
10,000.
>> So, she's had a reign of terror that's
gone on for quite a while. This is
scary.
>> Versus just a week ago. And not so
surprisingly, the top topic search
alongside Katie Porter at this point
interview. It turns out maybe you should
snap at a local political reporter.
>> Yeah. Or or just snap at your own. Like
this is the same thing. And then Oh,
you've got this one here too. Let's see
if I can find any more of this.
Uh rape. This woman is obsessed with
abortion. Yeah. Um,
authorities warned Katie Porter's grown
to 600 ft is currently rampaging through
San Francisco.
Oh god. And
is the uh President Biden has said that
inflation is the number one priority for
the Biden White House to try to get
under control right now. uh as you're
out there in California talking to
constituents uh during this re-election
year for Congress, uh h how does
inflation compare to this newly uh
important in the sense of the Supreme
Court decision pending uh abortion
issue? How do those two issues compare?
>> Well, I don't think they compare. I
think they actually reinforce each
other. So, the fact that things like
inflation can happen and it be can
become more expensive to feed your kids
and to fuel your car is exactly why
people need to be able to be in charge
of how many mouths they're going to have
to feed. So, I think the fact that we're
seeing this jump in expenses um that
we're seeing people having to pay more
in the grocery store, pay more at the
pump, pay more for housing, is a reason
that people are saying, "I need to be
able to make my own decisions about when
and if to start a family." So, I don't
think we're going to see them. I don't
think it's about comparing them.
>> So, you have to abort your kids for
inflation. Okay.
>> Contrasting them. I think they reinforce
for people just how big of a
responsibility it is to take care of a
family.
>> Yeah. Sure. Right. That doesn't sound
like it's too crazy, but all right,
let's look at a few more of these. I
mean, the Batwoman thing is I think this
is this one was crazy. Like, I'm sorry,
but if I see somebody do this and they
get mad and they drop their drink
because they're that mad, that to me,
that's it. I've seen enough, bro. Like,
I've already seen enough. I don't need
to go any farther than that. Uh, I think
that I already know more than enough.
You check Trump's truth. It's Halloween,
bro. No, it wasn't.
That's the thing.
I'm pretty sure it wasn't Halloween.
That's the issue.
Like I I'm not sure. Like was it
Halloween? Like I'm pretty sure it
wasn't.
It was not. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Right. I mean,
y'all getting worried about this and uh
soon Trump will lose or go to Oh, no.
>> Um and so people were like, "We got to
we got to think everything every
decision has to be made in tension with
Trump. Soon Trump will lose or go to
prison or I don't know have a heart
attack. I'm not sure. I don't know what
his demise is, but he'll have his demise
>> and the question will still be there.
Who are we as Democrats? Um and so
people
>> Jesus, bro, like what is wrong with her?
Oh my god. Yeah. So yeah, this is nuts.
And it's just who is this per Oh my god.
Border Patrol got Katie Porter. No. This
has got to be
>> What's your name?
>> Debbie Brockman. I work for WGN.
Let them know.
>> I got you. Yep. Debbie Brownie.
>> There's more than one of these things.
>> Brockman.
>> Brockman. WGN.
>> Oh my god.
Yeah. Holy [ __ ] guys.
