Yeah.
You see that title?
Yep.
When I read that, I said to myself, you
know why?
Because after seeing their vision, he's
realized that they've destroyed his baby
beyond repair.
There's nothing that he feels he can do
to save it. Personally, as a fan, I
believe he's the only one that can save
it.
But
he's moved past that. Can you imagine
building something that huge,
that important to people, pop culture,
the world,
selling it, seeing them totally destroy
it.
and have the ability to move past it and
leave it and not save it.
Man, I'd let out a scream like Superman
at the end of Superman 1978,
I believe.
And I'd be
I'd be turning the earth backwards so
that I could fix it. That's just me,
though.
So, it says here talking about
reluctantly adding some Star Wars items
to Lucas's uh museum of narrative art.
George Lucas has explained why he's
moved past the galaxy far far away that
he created after Disney took over.
It's been 13 years since George Lucas
film Disney uh Lucas Film to Disney sold
Lucasfilm to Disney for 4 billion.
That's a lot of money.
While Star Wars fans have been waiting
patiently for legendary filmmaker to
step back with the camera, that's what
we've all hoped for,
just like we've hoped for Zach to return
to DC to save it. Lucas has been busy
working on opening a museum. The project
has reportedly cost the 81year-old at
least 1 billion to put a billion dollars
to put together a museum. Am I handling
it? The Lucas Film, I mean the Lucas
Museum of Narrative Art is now on track
to open in Los Angeles next year. As the
name suggests, it will showcase
narrative art. But to the but much to
the disappointment of some, it isn't a
movie museum or even a journey through
Lucas Lucas's story career.
In fact, while speaking to the Wall
Street Journal, he explained why he's
eager for it not to become known as the
Star Wars Museum.
Quote, "It's one gallery out of 33, and
I did it
grudgingly."
Lucas said, "I didn't want people to
come to the museum and say, "Where's the
Star Wars?"
It will house an N1 star fighter from
1999 Star Wars the Phantom Menace, but
only one exhibit will be devoted to the
galaxy far far away and more
specifically its vehicle designs.
Adding the current state of the
franchise and how he would now views the
world he created. Lucas said
Disney took it over and they gave it
their own vision. That's what happens.
Of course, I've moved past it. I mean,
I've got a life. I'm building a museum.
A museum is harder than making movies. I
could believe that.
I was the only one who really knew what
Star Wars was, who actually knew this
world because there's a lot to it. He
shared the Force, for example, nobody
understood the Force when they started
other ones. After I sold the company, a
lot of the ideas that were in the
original sort of got lost, but that's
the way it is. You give it up, you give
it up.
This is sad.
Sad man.
Good lord.
Damn. I feel defeated as a fan.
But it is what it is. You know what? If
George can move on, I can move on. If he
can find the strength to move on, I can
move on.
Cuz Disney has made
Star Wars into something so
horrible,
something that you know if you were
beamed into this world and shown with
Disney shows for Star Wars,
but you were told that it was like one
of the greatest things to ever exist
cinematically,
but you were only shown Disney Star
Wars. You wouldn't believe it. Who
would?
