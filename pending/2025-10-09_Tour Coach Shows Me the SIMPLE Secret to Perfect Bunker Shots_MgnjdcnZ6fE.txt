Oh, there you go.
That's really nice.
That's flush.
Has it been a big problem in here?
Oh, yeah. It's been a hectic problem,
dude.
My bunker plays just not been good for
quite a while. So, I think it's
I don't know. I don't know. It's just
been not great um in terms of
controlling the depth in the sand, point
of entry. Like, it's all off. So
obviously when you combine those two
things, you got zero control where the
ball's going.
Mhm.
So I'm just going to shut up and
Yeah.
And I'm going to let you just do your
thing.
So come in and all I want you to do is
just walk up this line
and just
and all we're going to look at is your
entry point. See how literally every
wedge there
Yeah.
is identical.
Just three strikes. So, I just want to
see all we're going to do is just see
how consistently you can
deliver the club and where it tends to
be.
You're trying to deliver it just ahead.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We can snake.
That's it. Done. Done. Done. You're
good. You're good. Now, I'm going to get
in a bill for sand
laughing halfway through the drill.
[Music]
You see the first one
five inches behind. So I g I better get
it forward and just digging for China.
Yeah. So there you go. So anyway, well
at least now we know low points back.
Um unless unless you decide to dig for
China.
Um so so what we're going to do is
basically mate is just like set a couple
of things up now basic wise.
Okay.
Um this is just stuff that I see guys
doing this all the time. The way that I
like to start bunker practice is I just
like to draw. Let's say we're trying to
actually hold it. Like this is a really
hard bunker shot, by the way. If you've
got any
discomfort in
Yeah.
speed, you're not doing anything but
hitting this to 20 ft.
Yeah.
Yeah. So, it's like you've got to be on,
you know, earlier we talked about tempo
with the with the shorter stuff.
So important in the sand. Um, so a
couple of things that I want to do is
just we're just going to get a couple of
lines in to the target. We're then going
to draw one which is then where you're
going to dig your left heel onto. And
then you're going to drop one more which
is just slightly behind. That then is
going to be your shaft angle.
So you're going to dig your left heel on
here.
Open the face. I don't want your stance
to be open. I want it to be quite
square.
Okay.
And then from there then you're going to
be more forwards and handle more here.
Okay. And then from there then I'm
actually working my path normally if
anything more in than I am up and up and
across.
I'm normally working it a bit more kind
of in here and then I'm then on the way
down. The big thing that I focus on when
I'm in sand is tempo. Like I'm just big
on as slow as humanly possible with the
correct body motion. Okay? So I want you
to feel like you're swinging it at like
zero. Like it's hardly moving. Okay?
Because whether I'm hitting a shot
literally kind of
that far or whether I'm hitting it twice
the distance, I can still keep it kind
of long and slow. Even if I'm hitting
one a bit further, I can still
hit it like that and get it to But you
hit a strike on both of them. It's
really clean. Yeah.
So, I find very often tempo has the
biggest
impact on how clean I get it. The reason
is is that when I start to try and yank
on it to get that bit of speed, I then
start to drop backwards and that's when
my low point tends to
drag it and you don't throw it% bounce
and then you end up with these hot
things that are just you've got no and
the thing the thing is cuz the low point
drops back you then end up losing the
strike as well. So I'm almost in here.
I'm looking at it like line line and
then I'm almost drawing it off of that.
So left heel's digging in here. Club
face is nice. So you're almost kind of
trying to create that kind of look.
Handle back a little bit. Weight 75%
this way. Then I'm bringing it almost on
here. Yeah.
And then I'm releasing the club
almost up that line. You ever see that
video of like Tiger where he's doing
like this in the sand?
Yeah.
Yeah. It's just I'm just letting the
club head,
but I I kind of don't even really I
don't even kind of incentivize. I just
let it drop. I mean, for me, I just let
because I'm so smooth um in the tempo.
So, we're going to get into here. We're
going to do those and then all I want
you to feel as you come in here then is
that you're almost in like a two out of
10 tempo wise. Okay. So,
I mean, the biggest thing for me
straight away is working the club in.
And I kind of like that because the
stuff we've been doing with chipping
just now, which is more focused on
less me going like this and then like
this and more
almost feels like a bit drawy but I feel
very drawy. Yeah, exactly what it is.
It's great way of saying it.
Yeah, it's so much easier. It it would
seem
you just thought about it logically.
It's way easier to control entry point
and depth
when it's moving sort of like towards
target rather than
down and choppy.
Yeah. And the thing is, even if you had
to go down and get one, like, you know,
you know, let's say we're in the bunker
and there's no sand and you're like,
"Holy crap, like I can't come in shallow
on this." Yeah.
All you do is you would just instead of
changing the plane, I just get way on
top of it
and then I just thrust my arms more
under and that's how I get the arm and
the plane to change.
I don't really think more out, more in.
I just get more on top to naturally do
it for me. Yeah.
Um, but anyway, for a normal one,
so again, you're going to go in there.
You're going to feel weight 75% on the
left. That's it. And then from there
then the big thing James is you're going
to keep weight forwards and you're going
to draw it but you're going to feel like
it's almost like a you got to not add
anything onto it just smooth
speed. Yeah. A bit longer bit slower.
And just do that
on that little penny that you come to
land.
But again what you'll notice now is the
divot. Look. See how it's straight
through where you're going. It's not
going that way.
And it's it's it's not deep.
No. And
because you're not yanking on it,
that noise as well, you know, when you
you just know, don't you?
It's the sound of the bounce. Yeah.
Interacting with the sand.
But again, with the bounce, it's like
you don't even have to think about it.
Like when you do it that slowly,
it's like the club's just gathering.
Yeah. Cuz the club's just like working
through.
It's just doing that.
It's not going deep. It's just
It's not going like that. Look.
So dig the heel in. Wait. 75% left or
70% left. And just feel like you're
drawing it. But slow. Really slow,
James.
slow.
And the great thing is that would be
what you'd probably say was a hair heavy
even if we're being brutal. If we're
being brutal, but it's gone to 3 ft
because the ball speed slow.
I mean, to me that feels struck, but
I'm just talking off the sound of the
first one. Requirements are lower than
yours.
Do you know why though, James? It's cuz
I could hear that you just gave it a bit
of a
really
You can hear it in the sound. Yeah. But
you listen to the first one, you can
hear the the second one was more like
what? because I dragged it. But
a hair. You're talking a fraction. Yeah.
You just held on to it a fraction. And
that's what I mean. You got to slow it
down,
but really just kind of like
You hear that sound? It wasn't quite
like that, was it? It was a bit more.
It's a bit longer. Yeah. Just cuz you've
held a little bit. So, same thing. Just
let it go.
Still pretty bloody good, wasn't it?
It's just in.
That's it. No. Yeah. You don't add
anything onto but letting it go.
Yeah. It's almost imagining like the
club's just almost
like just Do you know what I mean?
You're not interfering with it.
That's it. Good.
Oh, that's the noise.
There you go. That's what I mean. So,
nice and drawy and then don't add
anything on.
It tried to be backed up and tried to
get it up, didn't you?
Yeah.
Don't have to. So, weight forwards,
handle back a little bit. That's it. And
then you're going to feel a bit more
like
drawy. There you go. And then from there
then just let that club head go from the
top. Nice and smooth. Don't add anything
on.
Almost. That was way better.
Oh, that was nice.
That was money, wasn't it? But think
about the shot there.
Yeah. But the speed though doesn't come
from trying to hit it harder. It just
comes from like letting it
gather a bit more. So it's just a bit
more
like that.
Okay.
Even kind of 40 yard bunk shots, I'd
just go 56.
Yeah. And I'd do nothing different. And
as long as I keep at that tempo, like it
just comes out so flush and they come
out so spinny
because it's just you just get so much
compression on it.
So weight forwards. That's it. Then just
feel it's in nice and smooth, mate.
Don't add on to it.
Oh, there you go.
That's really nice.
That's flush. Yeah, that's perfect that
one. Yeah,
you can hear it, can't you?
So smooth.
Yeah. And the thing, you don't got to do
anything crazy with it. Like we said to
you before you came in here, like if
you're doing anything that's too high
tempo on this, you're 25 feet.
How good is that?
Yeah.
And the thing is, James, you know, if
you've got to hit it further like I just
did over to that one.
Excuse my French
cuz it's not cool to sweat or have
tattoos apparently.
Yeah. You're not big, you're not hard,
but you come in again. Just hit me one
leg twice as long. But by doing it, all
you're gonna do, James, it's more just
longer.
Okay.
Longer. So, you're just changing the
length of it. That's it. Let the club
head go a bit more. So, see how I'm
doing a lot of the travel through the
club head.
I'm not really like I'm not turning
anymore or anything like that. I'm just
throwing the club head longer and
throwing it and then throw it through.
That's it.
Yeah, I like that.
Nice.
Again, that keeps everything minimal,
doesn't it, with the body, the hips, and
it makes it easier to do that.
Y.
So, same thing again, just longer. So,
weight forwards, still drawy, way
longer.
[Music]
Oh,
I mean, that is so nipped.
What else are we doing today?
Christ,
that's pure, isn't it?
That's really good.
Yeah, it's unbelievable, mate. And all
you think if you had an extra 10, 15
yards to go, all you're doing from there
is all you're doing is you're just up in
a club,
just going 56.
Play 56. You do the same thing. Um but
in regards to delivery was stuff like
the only thing that we've shown you
before obviously if you're super
shortsided you can start to mess around
with roll in the face a little bit which
we did a bit on. So let's just do that
again.
Okay.
See for whatever reason
you've got a super spin one.
Yeah.
Yeah. All you do is just I do the same
thing. I just roll the face way more on
the way back. So my forearms are
essentially going like that way more
just so I've got more bounce and loft.
Then I can be a bit more aggressive. But
I'm I'm not really doing anything
different. Yeah. It's more
I can just pop it up and spin it.
I should have.
But that's You see the difference in the
flight?
Yeah.
So what it does, it just gets the ball
to go that way more.
Okay.
Um but yeah, that's that's normally for
one like you know if you've got to get
one it's just out the lip kind of thing.
Yeah.
It feels mate. Trust me when I tell you
when you get on the course if you've got
a pin just there you're going to be
twitchy slowing it down cuz you're going
to be like
Yeah. But you just flush it.
Okay. So, it's just everything the same.
Everything the same. You're just going
to roll. Yeah. You're going to feel more
like this. So, go a little bit more like
that. And then you can throw it under
more.
You just rolled your right wrist over
that one a bit. That's why it's top. So,
see, see how that one there, if you look
at this,
see how it's like the pass gone left.
Yeah.
But that's what you did like when I
asked you to hit a high one on the chip
as well. Yeah.
It was like you kind of want to try and
what? Cuz I just need to Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. So, I'm I'm trying to unrelease
it, but in reality, I'm just trying to
throw it that way, aren't I?
And to be honest, mate, you don't even
need to like, you know, with the
momentum of the club head.
Yeah.
The club head, as long as you're not
doing anything, will always
like go. You don't need to really do
anything to the release, you know,
because we're trying not to add on.
So, it's just releasing.
You just added on there really. Yeah.
Just let the club drop. Yeah. So, rotate
it. You don't have to interfere. It's
slow.
Oh, there you go. Just do that.
How good's that?
It's nice though, ain't it?
Oh, Jesus. Well, that's done.
Bunkers. Bunkers.
Completed.
Done.
Completed it, mate.
Yeah. The thing is, if you want to go
further and further, it's just like
messing around with open face, square
face. But I would always with you
knowing your tendencies,
so you don't want to yank and pull back
behind it. I would always kind of have
that smooth tempo. So,
pretty simple, eh? Yeah.
