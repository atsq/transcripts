Have a look at these two faces. Which
one do you find more attractive?
Most people will instinctively choose
the one on the right. Despite the fact
that beauty is commonly labeled as
subjective, what makes most of you still
agree that the face on the right is more
attractive? It's because facial
attractiveness follows patterns that are
surprisingly consistent across age,
culture, and background. That's because
a face carries more than just features.
It communicates health, biology, and
presence all in a fraction of a second.
So, what actually makes a face
attractive? A key factor is hormonal
symmetry. Subtle traits shaped by
testosterone and growth hormones during
development. In men, that often means a
broad jawline, prominent cheekbones, and
deep set eyes. These characteristics
reflect testosterone exposure during
puberty, and a favorable testosterone to
cortisol balance. In a 2006 study by
Rooney Adal, men with higher
testosterone were rated more attractive
by women. Even when no one consciously
identified the traits they were reacting
to. Studies like those by Rooney and
colleagues show that even when people
can't explain why, they consistently
favor these traits in ratings of male
attractiveness. But hormone levels are
only one part of the equation. The way
your face develops, for example, forward
growth of the face is deeply affected by
the forces applied to it during growth.
Breathing through your nose and
maintaining proper tongue posture can
completely reshape the cranioacial
structure. This is the foundation of
orthotropic theory explored by Dr. John
MW and supported by research in
cranioacial orthopedics. A 2020 case
study published in clinical case reports
documented measurable forward facial
development in an adolescent following
consistent tongue posture and proper
breathing patterns. The conclusion was
clear. Form follows function. Even in
adults, habitual tongue posture with the
tongue resting fully against the pallet
can influence facial tone and muscular
engagement. Over time, this may improve
the definition and projection of the
midface. Jaw muscle tone is also part of
the picture. The massitor and temporales
muscles give structure to the lower face
and undertrained muscles tend to shrink.
Chewing harder substances like Spartan
gum can help maintain or even slightly
increase muscle definition. Research by
Killaritis 1995 found that greater
masticatory force directly correlated
with stronger, wider jawbones. And
there's also expression. Subtle facial
movements. The small, often subconscious
movements of the eyes, brows, and mouth
play a major role in how attractive and
emotionally tuned in a person appears.
Research by Keading suggests that even
minor changes in brow tension or eye
movement can shift how we perceive
someone's confidence or social power.
And here's where cold water therapy
becomes relevant. When your face is
exposed to cold, like splashing with
cold water, can trigger the diving
reflex, a calming response that
activates the facial muscles and vag
nerves. This doesn't just reduce
puffiness, it resets facial tension.
Many men carry chronic stress in their
faces, clenched jaws, furrowed brows,
and flat eye expressions. Nagaoka at all
2022 shows that cold exposure improves
blood flow to the periorbital region and
increases veagal tone. And of course,
nutrition matters. A combination of
nutrient-dense whole food diet can
quietly reshape how your face looks over
time. A diet full of essential vitamins
and minerals can support bone density,
skin clarity, and hormonal balance, all
linked to facial attractiveness. A 2009
study by Coetsi Adal even found that
diet quality could be judged by looking
at someone's face, and that people with
better nutrition were consistently rated
as more attractive regardless of their
body type. So, what does this all mean?
It means with the right habits, you can
create subtle but meaningful
improvements, not through shortcuts, but
through scientific inputs. And that's
exactly why I created Sparrow's Nest, a
school community focused on orthodontic
facial development. It's built for
anyone who want to build a more
attractive facial structure and enhance
their looks. If you're ready to
