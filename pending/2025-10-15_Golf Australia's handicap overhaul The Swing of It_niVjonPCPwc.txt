You know where a really good one would
be to do for this?
Melbourne.
It would actually be really good.
Yes. Yeah. Let me play Melbourne. Could
you imagine?
I love done professionally. I won't
drink. I promise.
Yeah.
You can have a few.
Could you imagine us playing it, showing
the course off, having showing how hard
it is to try and stop these balls and
then come Thursday, they're like, "Oh,
that's where bloody Ron had a 10."
Yeah. Meanwhile, they're watching the
President's Cup and Scotty's hauling out
on the first.
Yeah. It's like, "Good on you, Adam."
Because that was one thing when we went
to Cal,
you know, I've watched for the last
three years every event that's been out
there. It doesn't look anything like
what what you're seeing out there. You
know, just the camera just doesn't do
it. But we're able to get like, you
know, I'll stop Chopper from hitting a
shot and hold on, I want to go back here
and get it from a different angle and
whatnot.
Um, yeah, maybe we'll try and organize a
bit of that.
I did ask the PGA. It was like for
Cowgully. We sort of done it on our own,
but it'd be good if they could, yeah,
jump on board.
We're just trying to help Aussie golf.
I feel like a smoosh Melbourne or aston
might be
they don't let anyone film.
Isn't it crazy though how we're able to
reluctant were able to go to um the
Graange? Is it Grange Adelaide?
Oh yeah.
Before the live event.
That was cool.
Yeah. Now that you think about it. So
actually like take away the fact that
you're with
Oh, Ricky Boy,
the second biggest golf podcast in the
world.
third I think now
where we've taken spots one and two.
Oh yeah, we're so big. We're filling up
both spots.
Um but yeah, to get like access to play
on the course.
Yeah,
that's pretty cool.
Yeah, absolutely.
Yeah, imagine a smoosh Melbourne getting
us on that. That'd actually be a really
cool event.
Um
that that's when we do our dream board
that's up there.
What's the dream board?
Ah, we'll figure something out as dream
board as in like
goals
where we where this wants to go.
Oh yeah. Yeah, that's that's something
I'd love to Yeah, that's a goal to be
able to play Australian events before
the pros consistently and show
we're only helping.
Yeah,
cuz every whenever I watch a pro event,
that's all I think. How would I go out
there? Yeah,
we thought we'd break 100 at Oakmont and
we What did we get? 72.
Yeah, we absolutely blitz.
Nailed it.
Yeah, those chip out 110 m lob.
Did we talk about um
Oh jeez, I've lost track of it. No, I
don't mind. I've got so much going on.
Half this part is like, "Oh, you know
what? You know what?
Don't worry about it. Forget about it.
Who cares?"
Yeah. And then if you listen back, you
remember what you were about to talk
about. Yeah.
Getting caught in like the third world.
I'll tell I'll tell you what I think is
your issue is that you just on your
phone the whole time.
I'm trying to search on the the Golf
Australia handicap
what my handicap would be at Mount Lolly
off the tips.
Can I also ask a question cuz you my
score? Go on my score and do it.
That's what I am. Oh, my score.
Go on my score. Oh, of course. Yeah.
Yeah.
That's how you do it.
Um
I gave a guy a lesson yesterday and I
said, "Are you playing this week?" And
he's like, "Oh, there's no comps at the
minute because they're changing the
handicap system." I was like, "The
what?"
Yes,
they changed the handicap system.
Yeah. And I haven't done any research
about it, but what's happening there?
It's funny you asked that because I went
to do some research and forgot.
I also have no idea.
No. So, so what's happening?
I'm going to Google it right now real
quick.
You guys have a chat. I'll Google it.
So, Golf Australia are updating their
app and it's now going to be called
something different to that. Um, yes,
but what's they said that people's
handicaps will could potentially
fluctuate
five. Here we go.
Australia is overhauling its golf
handicapping system, transitioning from
the outdated Golf Link platform to the
new Golf Australia Connect system on
October the 2nd, 2025. So, this happened
a couple of days ago. uh and
implementing changes aligned with the
world handicapping system. Key changes
include a new formula for the daily
handicap incorporating a consistency
factor, a new nine-hole calculation,
handic handicap calculation, and the
inclusion of shorter and par three
courses for handicap purposes to promote
inclusivity and accuracy.
There you go. Oh, I also seen that
your your Golf Australia um number link
number what you know like
that is your number for the that's
everything for the rest of your life
that is your actual number. So when you
go and sign up at a new club that makes
sense that's good. Yeah so much sense.
So
go
everyone else everyone would have this
would have experienced you would have
experienced this last week if you were
out there.
Um and we probably should have spoken
about this on the top considering how
much it impacted our lives. Uh, but
there was that remember that temporary
offline period that they had from the
28th of October. Sorry, the 28th of
September to the 2nd of October, that
four or five day stretch last week where
they had no,
you couldn't submit any cards. Yeah. Um,
no social rounds or comps could be
processed for that transition period
from the 28th of September to the 2nd of
October late last week, early
none of that could be.
We are we are future. Um, I also did
have some confirmation. We spoke about
this a couple of weeks ago uh on the
American handicapping system. You know
how we had a chat about
Oh yeah. How they can just play whenever
they want.
Yep. I had a mate of mine um Jack who's
in uh over in Canada at the moment. I
can confirm there's no comp rounds and
you can put any single round in. There's
no requirements to sign cards and you
just have to tick you played with
someone. They all take gimmies in
competitive rounds. I said, "Is that in
Canada as well or is that just the
states?" He goes, "Can it as well?" He
said, "I'm not popular for making people
putt out as much as I say they should."
Playing actual golf.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So that in America and in Canada, you
can put a round in whenever you want.
You can just say that you're playing
with someone.
You don't have to submit it, but you can
submit it.
Yeah.
And people just give themselves gimmies
all the time.
Yeah. Right.
No wonder Europe beat him.
Yeah. Scotty's off bloody three.
Off three. Of course you are. Scotty
legend.
Oh wow. Okay. Um so
that's called cheating. That is straight
Jamie. It's literally cheating.
Yeah.
I don't get it.
How do you then play in like a team
event and there's like a prizes like
that completely null and voids the whole
there's no point having handicaps
