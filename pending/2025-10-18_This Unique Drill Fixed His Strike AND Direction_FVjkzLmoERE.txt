Is that one you see a bit?
>> That's the
Yeah, that's about But with the wedges
especially, it'll really accentuate
that. And
>> I mean, we're into off the right is
going to make it worse. So, you said
that you you hit a left
>> lack power left. Always off the bottom
groove, so the strike's always very
thin.
>> Okay.
>> Never take a divot.
>> Okay. And do you feel like you struggle
to control the face
>> with the shorter clubs? Yes.
>> I'd like to get your path a little
closer to zero. Mhm.
>> I'd like you to in feels and practice
probably work towards a fade.
>> Okay.
>> In reality, a slight draw would be okay.
Use my foot if you want to push against
it. Hold your head in position.
>> Show me where you think a good impact
would be.
>> Okay. Hold that there. So, you think you
can put a lot of pressure on my foot
from there?
>> Yeah.
>> You feel that's with this knuckle.
>> Probably this part of the finger on the
back of the shaft.
>> Yeah.
>> So, your shoulder alignment then when I
asked you to go to impact went left.
>> Yeah.
>> And your weight went forward.
>> Yeah.
>> Okay. Okay. And I held your head in
position.
>> Okay. Keep the club where it is.
>> At the moment, your impact is shoulders
are closed, head is back.
>> Yeah.
>> Now, what kind of pressure can you put
on the ball from there? No.
>> Nothing. So, if this is blocking off,
you're going to struggle to get your low
point
>> far enough forward.
>> You're going to struggle to get your
attack angle
>> and you're going to start to flip it
this way. So, your right arm through
impact works very much away from your
body this way. Okay?
>> But a lot of that is because it can't
continue this way because the body's not
supported. So if you just go set up
again. So the good thing here is when I
ask you to go to impact, do it again.
Impact. You know where that is. Yeah.
>> That's pressure. These have gone
slightly left. Your shoulder alignment
is going to be square to open.
>> Okay.
>> But at the moment it's closed.
>> Yeah.
>> But in order to do that, if you take a
setup again in the back swing,
>> Mhm.
>> there's a lot too much work going on
with the club and the hands, not enough
for the shoulders.
>> So what I mean by that is if you're
trying to hold his right shoulder in
place, I'm making this far worse, but
your arms doing a lot of work.
>> Yeah.
This is getting narrow.
>> Yeah.
>> Not a lot of turn. Then it turns and you
drift.
>> Yeah.
>> Then it stays there as you come down
here.
>> So we go back to start. So what I'm
going to try and get you to do is I'm
going to try and get this right shoulder
to work a lot more
>> early on.
>> Okay.
>> So you feel like
>> all of your turn is going to feel like
it's done
>> by the time your left arm gets
horizontal.
>> Wider. Wider. There you go. Get a little
softer in here. There we go.
>> Right now. Keep turning with the
shoulders. Keep turning the shoulders.
>> Those will be back.
>> There you go. That's what it's going to
feel like. Super wide in here.
>> Super wide with the hands and the
shoulders. And then from here, we're in
a position where we can start to get you
to work this body a lot more on top of
the golf ball and get you to feel like
you cover it.
>> Yeah.
>> And when you feel like you cover it, you
should feel like you can get the path
more left and stabilize the face.
>> Just look how much easier it is to
stabilize that face.
>> Yeah.
>> Doing this versus back there.
>> So, first little exercise I want you to
do. You've got stance closed, ball back.
>> Yes.
>> Which are both
>> always struggle with the feet aiming
left. Right even.
>> Yeah. Which are both draw components. So
if we're trying to move towards
something that's not a draw, we want to
neutralize that.
>> So I want you to go feet parallel to
that.
>> Mhm.
>> And then I want the ball to be one ball
further forward for you.
>> Okay.
>> So I'm looking at that. That's just for
the center. Yeah. And that will feel
very, very strange to you. Okay. As much
turn as you can.
>> Now stretch the hands out to hit my
hand. Beautiful. Now just turn through.
>> Yeah, it feels in my normal swing
is that I go sort of here and it is
quite narrow, isn't it? It
>> is.
>> Yeah, your shoulders get a little flat,
but obviously we can't
>> Yeah.
>> target everything.
>> So, do you want to do that same job
again?
>> So, onto your shoulder, big turn. And
the key thing is you stretch your hands
away from your shoulder. So, no matter
whether it's short, we're looking for
wide.
>> Okay.
>> Excellent.
>> It be hitting the ball. It's because
we've moved the ball. We've got you
wider. There's a lot of things going on
there.
>> At impact, my head is back.
>> Yeah.
>> My shoulders are closed. Where's my low
point going to be? Right of the ball.
It's
>> going to be more back here.
>> So, the the the movements you've got
head back, shoulders closed. Move the
low point back.
>> So, the way that you would overcome that
to at least kind of half strike it would
be to move the ball back. So when we've
moved the ball forward,
if your impact is still head back,
shoulders closed, you can't get to the
bottom of the ball now. But that's only
because
>> So I'm not covering it.
>> Correct. It's only because we've moved
the ball forward.
>> We've worked on this. We haven't done
anything down swinging. As soon as we
start to get you to turn onto it more,
you can get your low point over here. So
at the moment, it's say P. We've gone
ball forward. Your impact is still here.
>> So you just old can't get the golf ball.
So don't worry about strike yet. But I
wanted to move the ball early on.
>> You're closer to strike that time.
>> Yeah.
>> So, here's the next exercise.
>> Still the same thing. Imagine that's
your golf ball. So, it's still
>> forward.
>> You still got your alignment parallel to
the alignment stick. You're still going
to go shoulder.
>> Okay.
>> Turn stretch. And then I want you to
think about the movement of this and how
the movement of this would allow you to
swing through and land the club
>> the other side, the other side. And
essentially
this at the moment is wanting to go up,
which does two things. It tips the head
back and keeps the shoulders closed.
Your lead shoulder is going to almost
move what you kind of feel is down and
around more.
>> Now, I don't mind in these exercises
whether you go
extreme. I'm just looking for a
different movement.
Let's not use that cuz it's going to
blow. It's going to blow away. Right
onto your shoulder. Turn wide. Right.
Hold it there. Now, you're not going to
swing through this time.
>> But as you shift forward, this is going
to feel more in there. There we go. Now,
you can land that club side. Yeah.
>> So, you don't have to necessarily go at
full speed. I just want you to make some
swings, you go super wide, then turn,
land it later.
>> Excellent. That's good. Okay. And again,
we're still together. Come on. I want
you to go here slower than that, but
make it land later.
Later. Later.
Superb.
Turn wide.
Love that
shoulder. Turn. Stretch it. Okay. Shift
with the hips forward. That's it. Good.
Beautiful. Then you just feel like you
cover it this way.
>> So feel like it's that way with
everything.
>> Yeah. The only thing I' got to be
careful of is Joe can see it from here.
>> I don't want to cover it by going hips
back.
>> Yeah.
>> Chest on. I want you to cover it by
going hips forwards. And that's the only
thing I want to So that's why I'm trying
to get you to go hips forwards.
>> So there wide turn and cover it.
>> So the next stage, take your setup this
time, leave the ball where it is.
>> Mhm.
>> So clubing your shoulder, turn, extend.
So this time we're going to basically
try and create exactly the same down
swing, but the ball is in the correct
position. Y
>> So we're doing we're trying to achieve
those numbers, but the ball correct. And
then the stage after that was we don't
do the
>> back
around, of course.
So, shoulder turn wide. Same movement.
Cover it.
>> So, even though this ball is where it
should be, I almost want you to trick
yourself into thinking it's still
>> where it was.
>> Cuz I want you to get this this chest
more on top.
>> Good shot. Really good. A draw.
>> Your path is right. Yeah.
>> Face is close to that.
>> Yeah.
>> So, for let's say 20 years,
>> your face has pretty much was had to be
close to the path.
>> Yeah. because if it's not close to the
path, you just get a block.
>> So, what we've done is obviously we've
changed a bit of back swing. We've
changed a little bit of the path. And on
these shots, your path is slightly left
now.
>> But we've not told your club face that
it needs to be somewhere different.
>> So, at the moment, your path is left.
Your club face is still slightly left of
the path because that's where it's
always been. I wouldn't change that
today because I know you as a golfer if
you kept your path at pretty zero to
slightly left wouldn't take you that
many practice sessions for you just to
figure out that hang that face doesn't
need to be closed and that would be
something you do through skill. So for
me the face in this case can be reactive
to the path. If we can just keep you
hitting balls where your path is
slightly left,
>> you'll just start to change that release
and that'll be a better way. We can give
you some tips on how to do it but I
think you just do it over time. Just put
the club target side of the ball and
just imagine you're going through impact
as if you follow through to right. So
the next swing all I want you to do
>> same drill shoulder.
>> Yeah.
>> Cover it and just imagine that face
>> is more way more sky
>> on on at this point here. So three feet
past exactly. So trail hand is more
under.
>> Okay.
>> And you should find this one won't go as
far left. So shoulder turn wide cover it
hand under. There you go.
>> That's one over there. Really good with
the wind. That's perfect.
>> Yeah.
>> Really good. So, it's just a bit of face
awareness which won't say There you go.
So, path at zero.
>> Yeah.
>> Really good. Face still close a
fraction. Go. One more. Good.
>> And then we'll take the back screen
drill out for you.
>> There you go.
>> Didn't see that one. But
>> so that one needs a bit of practice, a
bit of, you know, a bit of development,
but that's your movement really because
your path. There you go. Really good.
>> Okay.
>> Really good.
>> Awesome.
>> So, let's hit some shots now where
you're just trying to take that back
swing and drill out.
So, we haven't really touched much on
the back swing. We did it through a
drill. So, you've got to imagine the
length between your right wrist and your
right shoulder.
>> You got to feel that length stays
constant throughout the whole golf
swing.
>> It won't.
>> Cuz this has got to fold at some point.
I just don't want it to fold too early.
So, you keep turning, keep turning, keep
that as wide as you can.
>> Yeah.
>> And then you're going to turn through.
For these shots, let's make this back
swing what you feel is half speed.
>> Half speed. Half speed back swing.
>> Half speed back swing. So, super super
wide with that trail arm. To be fair, I
forgot about the down swing on that one.
So,
>> only got capacity for
>> Yeah, one thing at a time.
>> There you go. P was two. It wasn't too
bad. That was good.
>> But this way becomes hard, isn't it?
Because you got a couple of components
and to do them all in one go is
>> so on that back swing takeaway though
cuz again, the feeling I have when I'm
hitting it better is feeling I'm taking
it out side rather than the quick in.
>> Yeah.
>> But do you want me just to just feel
like it's a natural sort of take back
rather? Well, if you if you put the club
across your shoulders, go just do a
little half back. You tend to get the
shoulders a little flat.
>> Yeah.
>> So, we're trying to get this to control
the movement and be wider if you wanted
to get that sensation that's going more
up as opposed to behind you. That will
keep more tilting shoulders. So, if you
go back to setup, so what you could do
is you could sort of almost kill two
birds with one stone. You could keep the
shoulder moving but make it go more up.
Okay?
>> Which will keep the left shoulder low
because you do get a little flat. But I
wouldn't I wouldn't want to over
complicate it at this stage. I'm just
trying to get wider at the top.
>> Okay,
>> that's it. Then really cover it. Try and
land that club what you feel is like six
inches after the ball.
>> But this is why I mean your path was
good there. He just didn't strike. This
is why it's always better to break the
swing down because when you needed a
couple of little tweaks and when you
break them down you can put them
together and then as soon as you start
to do it in one go becomes more
difficult. So in practice you would be
breaking it down. And we're just trying
to put these together. That's it. Give
it super exaggerated
>> like a Alex Lauren.
>> Yeah. There you go. Super wide and then
really get on top of it. I land the club
later. Pack his left. Oh, mate. That was
buttoned. How good was that?
>> That was the best swing you bit.
>> Just need a bit of pressure. There you
go.
