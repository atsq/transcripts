You're tuning into
Black and White Sports on YouTube. The
no holds barred truth on sports. The
main event starts. All right, black and
white sports reporters. Let's talk about
Nicia Collier and Kathy Inglebert. And
somehow someway South Carolina coach Don
Staley found a way for her to butt her
way into this, stick her nose into this.
If she can find any way to put some
shine on herself, she's going to do it.
Now, in case you cannot tell, I'm not
the biggest fan in the world. I think
she's made some utterly insane
statements over the years.
mostly politically related.
Um but uh wow she has come out and she
is calling Nefia call your brave. Is she
also stunning and courageous? Dawn
inquiring minds want to know. And you
know what's interesting?
Let's just let's just put it out there.
Have you guys noticed
how the sports media, the mainstream
sports media
has not bothered to call out Nefia
Collier's conflict of interest for
unrivaled at all?
They don't even mention it. When's the
last time you heard it brought up
that, hey, this may not be
the best voice to have on this?
Why is Hawer and Bana Stewart still
involved in the WNBA players association
as representatives, as vice presidents?
Why is no media out? This is the most
obvious conflict of interest that there
possibly is. No media outlet will touch
it.
No media outlet will touch it.
And I'm sorry, but it's because of the
WNBA's politics, their social issue
crap, all of it. They're protected.
I'm not protected. I don't care. I I I
don't care. I I I don't care. I'll call
him out.
That's the point of me being here.
Front Office Sports.
Uh all you other ESPN weak
weak
that you guys will not step out there
and and talk in public, write an
article. It should be an actual article
from all these major outlets. No,
nothing
cowards. Couple of weeks ago, Minnesota
Link star Nicia Collier blasted league
commissioner Kathy Ingleberg during her
exit interview and shook up the
negotiations between the WNBA players
association and the WNBA over the new
collective bargaining agreement. South
Carolina head coach Don Staley, one of
the biggest names in women's basketball,
was asked for her opinion on call your
statement during Tuesday's SEC media
day. Okay. Well, we're there to talk
about my team in college basketball, but
let's talk about this.
Good grief.
It's ridiculous. quote, "It sounds like
it's personal in her perspective of the
situation and I think people have to
understand they're negotiating, right?"
Staley said, "So, in negotiations, like
any other issues that come up, there's
always going to be an emotional
attachment and then there's facts. Once
we get down to the facts, I do think
it's going to get done. I look at the
end of the day I don't believe Adam
Silver the NBA commissioner is going to
allow a lockout.
I do not think that's going to happen.
Now are they going to get what they're
looking for with the equity percentage
split blah blah blah? No.
No. Not not to the extent. What I highly
recommend they do
is, and Ken Swift brought this up on X,
is negotiate a new deal, get the huge
salary increase, and then if you want
the salaries to be able to continuously
move up with the growth of the league,
you make it a three-year deal, and in
three years, you go back to the table.
It It's that simple. But
there's not a massive need to negotiate
another one anyway, unless there's
another big increase in the media rights
deal, which there shouldn't be for quite
some time. That's where this money comes
from. Sure, there's other avenues,
but that's what moves the needle.
Both of them are playing the sides they
need to play. I think it was brave a fee
to step out there and put her name on
the line when it comes to where the
players stand. And at the same time, you
look at Kathy Ingleberg, and I don't
think there's another commissioner that
has accomplished what she has for the
state of women's professional
basketball. So, they're negotiating.
It's part of it. Sounds to me like she
might have a little
bit of a relationship with Kathy. She
doesn't just outright dog out Kathy
Ingleberg there at all. The South
Carolina coach who played in the WNBA
from 99 to 2006
brings an interesting perspective
because there were not a lot of
opportunities for women's basketball
players early in her career. In fact,
Staley used to dream of playing in the
NBA because there was no WNBA when she
was growing up. Now she is one of the
top college basketball coaches at a time
when college sports are gaining immense
popularity.
Staley saw 10 of her former players
listed on WNBA rosters this season,
including Las Vegas Aces star Asia
Wilson, who's fresh off her fourth MVP
and her third WNBA championship.
Well, unless I'm not going crazy. Isn't
Aaliyah Boston? didn't she come out of
South Carolina?
And um
um the player in Chicago,
uh Camila Cardoso, in her statement,
Collier relayed personal conversations
she had with Ingleberg earlier this
year. She accused the commissioner of
saying that players should be on their
knees thanking their lucky stars for
media rights deal and that Caitlyn Clark
in particular should be grateful for the
league because without the WNBA pl the
platform the WNBA gives her she wouldn't
make anything. And of course we know
that's absolutely absurd.
We know this league pivot and hinges
and tips
on the success of Caitlyn Clark.
That's all there is to it. The whole
damn league.
Because I promise you, if all of a
sudden Caitlyn Clark retired,
NBC and any other networks that were
going to continue doing NBA/WNBA
business
would be going to Adam Silver and Kathy
Ingleberg going, "Look, we paid this
massive amount of money because of
Caitlyn Clark,
not any of these other players. Caitlyn
Clark.
I mean, we saw how the ratings, the
fever interest, and I can tell you again
based on channel analytics, the moment
the day that they came out and said she
wasn't coming back. Yeah. Just like
that.
Just like that. Well, the ratings. Yeah.
The ratings that are getting bolstered
by a new system.
I would love love love
to find out what the ratings actually
were based on the way they did it in any
previous year.
So, I don't want to hear the ratings
next year. We can compare next year's
ratings to this year's ratings. That's
where it starts and stops.
All right? The year-over-year
comparisons are over. If a media
outlet's got any guts, that's how it
should be handled.
But just like the conflict of interest
of Nefia Collier owning Unrivaled,
they're not going to bring that other
part up.
Like Front Office Sports the other day
when they buried that down in the fifth
fifth paragraph of a ratings article.
Don Staley seems like she's she's trying
to back caller here, but let's be
honest, she's playing both sides of the
fence.
All right. And part of that may be
does she want to eventually coach a WNBA
team? Although I would venture to say
she might actually make more money
coaching at South Carolina.
I wonder about that. I'd have to look.
That's interesting. New York Liberty job
is open, by the way. and they were
talking about getting her for the next
job and I was like that ain't going to
happen. You can forget that. Tell me
what you think. Peace. I'm out. Till
next time.
