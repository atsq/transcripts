President Trump secures the release of
the Israeli hostages, the end of the
Gaza war, and for now at least, peace in
the Middle East. It is the most
significant international achievement of
a presidential administration in
decades. All of President Trump's
critics have to eat crow. He did the
impossible. And Trump's enemies are so
angry about it, they shaved off his
hair.
>> I don't know if I agree with everything
Michael knows. null said in that uh
statement you just watched, but I do
agree with the last statement about
Trump and his appearance on the cover of
a magazine. So, the cover in question is
uh for Time magazine and uh I'm not
going to lie, they did use possibly the
most unflattering photo that they
possibly could. I
>> I don't know that they did that. Okay,
Jane,
>> come on. No, no, no, no. Hold on. Hold
on.
>> His neck looks like a vagina.
>> Okay. All right. That's fair. But
listen, uh, let
me go through a couple of things. First
of all, is it an unflattering photo?
Yeah, sure. Anytime you take a picture
from down below, it's a disaster. I
wouldn't want it, right? So, I'm not
disputing that.
>> U, but do I think time did it because
they hate Donald Trump? It's then why
would they write about his triumph,
right? So, and I think what they were
actually trying to do is create a halo
around his head. And the only way you
could do that is if the light is coming
up from above. So, I think they were
trying to do him a favor, but royally
screwed it up and wound up having it be
accidentally assaulting.
>> So, let me just say something about
human psychology. Okay. Um,
>> whenever friends of mine take photo like
we're out, we're drinking, we're having
a good time, they take a group photo or
photo of me and then they post it on
social media and I have determined it's
an unflattering photo of myself. I
automatically assume they hate me. They
did it because they hate me. Yeah.
>> So, like I don't blame anyone for
thinking that, but I actually agree with
you. I don't think if Time hated Trump,
they wouldn't want to feature him at all
on the cover. Uh, and so,
>> you know, Anna, I have a much bigger
problem with the cover that no one's
talking about. Okay. So, they
>> vagina neck.
>> No, not that.
>> You're okay with that?
>> Yeah.
>> All right. Jen likes vagina necks.
>> No, I'm just saying the brother's old.
It's okay. It happens. It's not his
fault on that one. The overeating on the
other hand, but I live in a glass house,
so you know, God bless. So, I'm I don't
care about his looks at all. Not 1%.
They say his triumph about the deal.
Okay. Look, I I wish the Israelis would
follow the deal. I like the deal if both
sides followed it. Right? So, I get it.
No problem there. They say the leader
Israel needed.
>> Come on.
>> Why does Israel need our president to be
their leader? And why is that an
acceptable thing to put on the cover of
Time magazine? like we're all supposed
to serve Israel and bravo Trump, you're
the leader Israel needed, not America
needed, but Israel needed. So, thank God
you served Israel. What is that? So,
that's why like these guys are kissing
his ass royally because they think he
delivered for their beloved Israel.
That's why I don't think they were
trying to harm him with the picture.
>> No, you're exactly right that there is
no way in hell they were trying to do
Trump dirty with this cover. They just
have bad taste because it is an
unflattering photo. But the whole point
of the cover and the piece they wrote
about him was to celebrate him as as
someone who accomplished something
miraculous when in reality we all know
there is no peace deal and this
ceasefire is super super fragile and
shaky. So, you know, that's probably my
biggest issue with the news that's come
out this week. like the like Pierce
Morgan like I get it. You are buddies
with Trump. It's like he can't wait for
any opportunity to like kiss Trump's
ass. And it's like I get it. You guys
are hitting each other up on the phone.
You're buddies. You're friends on the
show. That's why it's part that's access
journalism.
>> It's so annoying. Just be real about
where we are in this ceasefire. Okay.
Just be accurate about it. It's not a
peace deal. It's a ceasefire. Ceasefire
is super fragile. People are still
getting killed, not to the same extent
as earlier, but once they get the
remains of all the deceased hostages,
I'm worried that Israel is going to go
back in and continue annihilating.
>> Yeah. I mean, look, look at how
desensitized we are. They used to kill
like 90 people a day. They're down to
like nine people a day. And we're like,
"Oh, aren't the Israelis so merciful?
They're only murdering nine civilians a
day." And and they cut half to eight.
Oh, instead of starving them completely.
How merciful are the Israelis? Oh, thank
God we have a leader that serves Israel.
>> Okay, one final funny point about this
story. I saw people on social media
posting the picture of the cover and
censoring his neck.
>> Gavin Newsome did it to be fair to
Gavin.
>> Don't give him credit.
>> No, I'm giving him credit. Damn it.
>> Cuz we're the fairest show in America.
Credit where credit is due. It was
funny. It's funny. Photoshop the neck.
So, you know, dirty dirty.
>> You're rich. You could do something
about it. I don't know. I don't know why
he doesn't.
>> No, that's crazy talk. Okay. Uh, just be
yourself. It's okay. Although with Trump
being yourself is also an issue. But
anyway, every time you ring the bell
below, an angel gets his wings. Totally
not true. But it does keep you updated
on our live shows.
