The government has given up on house
prices. You know what really gets me?
When people who were meant to keep this
whole system under control just throw
their hands up and say, "Yeah, there's
nothing we can do." And that's exactly
what's happened here. First, it was the
politicians admitting their housing
policies have backfired, and now it's
the Reserve Bank. The RBA has basically
said, "House prices not our problem."
So, hang on with me for a couple of
minutes because I'm going to show you
exactly what the RBA governor just said.
why it's one of the most chilling
messages we've ever heard for first home
buyers and what this means for the
future of Australia's housing market.
Let's start with what's happening right
now. House prices are hitting new highs
again. September saw another big jump.8%
nationally, guys. That is huge. This is
the biggest monthly rise in almost 2
years. Every single capital city is up.
Even regional areas are climbing. We've
had three rate cuts already this year,
February, May, August, taking the cash
rate down to just 3.6%. Guys, this is
historically a very low interest rate.
And what happened? Prices kept climbing.
They're now 6% higher than a year ago
with some cities running way hotter than
that. So, naturally, people started
asking the RBA the question, "Aren't you
worried? This is getting out of
control." And the answer from the RBA
Governor, Michelle Bulock, was chilling.
She literally said, "There's nothing I
can do." Think about that. The most
powerful person in the country when it
comes to money, our money, the nation's
money, the one who moves rates, the one
who shapes our economy, is saying she
can't do anything about housing. Her
exact words were, "All I can do is keep
inflation low and employment strong.
There's nothing I can personally do
about house prices. We don't target
them." And look, Michelle's actually
right about one thing. When they cut
rates to support the economy, it does
make housing more expensive. But the RBA
is saying that's just part of how their
system works. They're not even trying to
stop it anymore. And here's another
shocker. Not long ago, even the prime
minister came out and said his
government's 5% deposit scheme will push
prices higher. He tried to downplay it,
saying it'll only be a slight increase.
But come on, we all know what that
means. If the PM himself is saying his
own scheme is going to make housing more
expensive, that tells you everything.
Because what's happening right now, it's
absolute madness. The politicians are
admitting their policies are broken, but
they keep doing it anyway. They roll out
these quick fixes, short-term sugar
hits, anything to win a headline or
score votes during an election. But
who's actually thinking about the next
generation? Who's looking out for the
future of this country? Because every
move they make is just making it harder
for everyday Aussies to buy a home. So,
what are we doing? Who's taking
responsibility for this? Now, that might
sound technical, but here's why it
matters. For years, we've been told that
the RBA is watching everything. the
economy, inflation, unemployment, the
property market. But now they have
basically said, "Yeah, house prices will
go the way they go, not our job." So
while everyday Aussies are getting
priced out, the people in charge are
admitting they can't control it. And
it's not just that they can't. They
never really have. Every time they drop
rates, prices boom. Every time they
raise rates, prices slow for a bit and
then take off again. They've lost
control of it. And now they're just
saying it out loud. Now, here's the real
problem that we do have. Property supply
building approvals have absolutely
crashed, down 6% in August after an 8%
drop in July. We're now building less
than 200,000 homes a year when we need
at least 240,000 just to catch up. So,
while demand keeps growing, the number
of new homes keeps falling. So, what's
the government's plan around this?
Another round of affordability schemes,
the 5% deposit program, higher price
caps, more stimulus. It's the same old
story. More demand, more demand,
stimulus, more policies that drive more
demand. nothing around solving the
supply crisis. Every new policy just
adds fuel to the fire. We actually have
a structural problem around the
production of new property, new
affordable property for people to get
their start on the property ladder.
Michelle Bulock said it straight.
Housing policy is a matter for
government. That's her way of saying,
"Don't look at us. The RBA's job is to
control inflation, not house prices.
Existing homes aren't even part of the
inflation numbers they target. They look
at rents and new build costs, but not
the price of the house you buy. So, when
house prices go through the roof, they
can say, "Well, technically that's not
inflation." Meanwhile, home values have
risen by over $120,000 in just 3 years.
And the average first home buyer in
Sydney, for example, now needs 7 years
to save a deposit. And the RBA's answer,
there's nothing we can do. So, they're
literally saying house prices are not
part of your cost of living. This is
madness, guys. So, what happens next?
The big banks think more cuts are coming
in 2026. Westpack reckons November,
February, and May. Every one of those
cuts will pour more petrol on the fire.
And with the government's 5% deposit
scheme now live, first home buyers are
rushing in. We're seeing in the numbers
right now. Supply is at record lows and
continuing to lower even more. Migration
is still adding tens of thousands of new
buyers every year. Even the RBA knows
what's coming, but they've said it's
totally out of their hands. So, if
you're hoping the central bank was going
to step in and cool this market down,
they won't. They've basically said,
"Good luck, Australia." So, here's the
truth. House prices are taking off
again. The RBA knows it. The government
knows it. Everybody knows it. The RBA
governor has flat out said she can't
stop it, and it's not their job. They're
focused on inflation and jobs, not
housing. Meanwhile, approvals are
falling, supply is collapsing, and
demand is rising. So, when the RBA cuts
rates again next year, and they will,
prices are going to shoot even higher.
This isn't a plan. This is a surrender.
The people in charge of the economy are
admitting they've lost control of the
housing market. And that right there
tells you everything about where we're
headed. So, all of this is great news if
you're a property investor because, as
you can see, demand is going to remain
high. The cost of money, the cost of
debt is going to get even cheaper and
even better. People's cash flow is going
to improve. And this means that if you
place your money into assets,
residential property, you are going to
ride a wave of inflation growth of the
property market over the next 5 to 10
years, this is going to set you up very
strongly for your financial freedom. If
