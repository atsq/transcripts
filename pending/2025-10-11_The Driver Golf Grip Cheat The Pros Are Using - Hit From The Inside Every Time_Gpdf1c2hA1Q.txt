let's stop coming over the top losing distance 
slicing drives losing them off to the right You
can fix this problem It's a common problem but you 
can really fix it And what we're going to do today
is really change the way you think about the golf 
club as a whole and how it swings around your body
This is such a simple driver lesson that's going 
to help you hit this longer and straighter every
time So we've all seen that kind of drive You do 
it your friend does it We see these actions where
the club wants to get out over here early and 
then we're pulling across the ball even backing
up into it and hitting slices Let's stop that And 
the easiest way for you to stop that is to change
the part of the club you're actually thinking 
about So often what golfers are thinking about
is maybe where their hips are going maybe a little 
bit about where their arms are going and certainly
maybe thinking like the club needs to be coming 
from in here and where's the club coming from so
they're really latching on to this part of the 
club or maybe an internal part of their body But
today I want you to think of this bit the grip 
This is the bit we're going to start thinking
about And in particular I want you to think about 
a top end and a bottom end So this is the bottom
end This is the top end Now at my grip I've got 
a white bit around the top and a white bit around
the bottom And I'm gonna reference these two 
white circles around my grip in relationship to
each other So as I set up to the ball the bottom 
part of the grip is forwards of the back part of
the grip So if this is back this is forwards This 
is back of this which makes sense You obviously
aren't setting up this way or with them stacked 
on top of each other Then as the club goes back
what will get slightly confusing but hopefully not 
too confusing is they're going to switch positions
Meaning that's now the top That's now the 
bottom But I'm going to refer to this always
as the bottom Even when it flips So the bottom 
part of the grip to the top part of the grip
is how I'm going to reference it And yep they're 
going to flip because obviously the club's going
up and over your shoulder Now as I set the 
club back point one you need to try and do
As I set the club back I want the bottom part of 
the grip to be back of the top part of the grip
which I think lots of you know you're not going to 
set it back here You'll stop and look It's going
slower at this point You'd feel that's crazy Lots 
of you will do that where the bottom part of the
grip is back of the top bit Now here's the real 
kicker Then what I'm gonna do on the down swing
is to get my club coming more from the path 
I want it to come from here to try and stop
me over rotating early and chucking everything 
out here where they start to stack up So from
this camera you can see they're starting to get 
on top of each other Bottom of the grip to the
top I am going to try and get the bottom of the 
grip to stay behind So behind the top of the grip
for as long as I physically can because what will 
happen at the bottom is they're going to catch up
So if you think about this angle this is back of 
this If I just rotate my body because the camera's
fixed they're going to catch up I'm not actually 
moving that out That club is just catching up with
that camera meaning it's lining up Then to hit 
the ball that bottom part will just throw out
So by trying to keep the bottom end of the grip 
back of the top end of the grip by default you're
going to start hitting from the inside It's 
just going to happen And the more I do this
with students getting them to not focus on where 
the club is but the bit they're actually holding
the bit they're putting forces through the easier 
it gets for them to start controlling their drives
to get a little bit more of that shape in there 
So think about this as a drill next time you're
practicing with your driver to get rid of that 
over the top action to get rid of those slices I
want you to hit a few shots Don't worry where the 
ball goes where you make demo back swings where
you try and keep this end back of this end So the 
that circle's back of that circle and you can even
stop and look and then just chip that ball out in 
front of you It's not going to go in the air cuz
there's not enough speed It's going to dip and 
go left hopefully But this is going to train you
to feel where the bottom and the top end of the 
grip in relationship to each other are and get
away from the head which so many of you cannot 
feel where it is And the main reason I think so
many have success with this is you're holding on 
to this bit So you can control this bit easier
because you could even think about where you're 
bringing your force through the club So let's say
as I start down I'm putting force kind of on the 
top side of the club just to push it down I'm not
running force this way through the club to get 
this to catch up with this So again to try and
feel that you can just drop your hands down trying 
to keep this back from this end And at the same
time you're not putting force that way through the 
grip pushing it that way You can feel that That's
something that's tangible for you to feel And then 
you're going to find this club's coming from this
better path and then out to the ball Because we 
see so many golfers they over rotate definitely
too early but they also then want to put force 
this way through the shaft also that way through
the shaft which stacks it up And the bit you're 
holding controlling this end to this end is huge
And one little bonus tip if you're struggling 
to feel it set yourself up split your hands on
the club So hold the bottom bit with trail hand 
hold the top bit with lead hand And what you're
going to find is that you're much easier to just 
hold that top bit back for a little longer this
way Get the feeling of this end of the grip 
bottom being behind top Bang And then you're
going to try and apply that to your drives In the 
comments down below does that make sense or not
is it something you thought about and tried over 
just thinking about the club and if you want to
find out how far you should be hitting this driver
