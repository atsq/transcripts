Do girls like fast pumps or slow pumps?
Slow. Fast. Slow.
Fast. I like it slow. Both. Fast then.
Yeah. Fast.
[Music]
Start with the slow and then move on to
the fast. Both. It depends on the the
mood, the timing, wherever we are.
Music. Doesn't matter.
Fast. Probably
fast.
I think everyone does know. I think it
depends on the size.
So, every size?
Every size?
Oh, medium. Medium pump. Fast. Slow for
me.
A bit of both.
I like both.
Both. Yeah. Okay. We've got a hybrid
here.
Hybrid.
I think I think more of a slow. You
know, it's nice to have that slow
intimate sex. You know, it's not, you
know, I mean, fast it's like, okay, then
they just finish faster and it's like,
oh, that was boring.
Why do you prefer the fast bounces?
I It's just better. I don't know. It
just feels good. Self-explanatory
really, isn't it?
Do you find it more intense or romantic?
Uh, both.
Both. Okay. But you don't like the small
ones?
I mean, so is okay.
I just feel like it's more um rhythmic.
Intimate.
More intimate. You find it fast.
More intimate.
Interesting.
I I would say yes because it it shows
like the want and the feeling. Do you
know what I mean?
Yeah, I do. I feel like slow pumps is
boring.
Slow pumps are boring.
Way more into it.
But if you can go fast, you don't really
care about who you're with. You're just
going for it.
So true. You can have sex with anyone.
It's more fun. Like
more fun. The
energy is going and like
cuz it's intense.
Oh, intensity of it.
Rough sex. Oh, duh.
Why do you prefer the slow pumps?
Oh, I don't know. There's more rhythm to
it. There's more attention.
Do you find it more romantic?
Yes. Yes, I do. I don't know. Mization,
I think like you get the time to enjoy
it even though it's slow and you get to
feel everything. You can take time, you
know. You don't have to be fast because
if you want to to
uh if you want longer, so you have to be
like slow. It's just nicer, you know? I
think it's a little bit more intimate
than, you know, just [ __ ] really
fast, you know? It's It's more intimate
and I think it's better.
Tell me why fast and slow together for
you.
Oh, because we need a bit of both. You
don't want it to be boring. Just the
same thing.
Because sometimes depending on the guy
who's wanting to get it over with,
you know, so the fast punks really gets
the job done. And then if it's with the
right guy, then going slower makes it
last longer.
I I It's just how my buddy likes it, I
guess.
Okay. Slow and fast together, right?
I like this. I don't know
which one makes you moan louder, fast
pumps or small pumps.
Oh my god.
Fast.
Fast. Okay.
Probably fast.
Fast pumps.
Fast.
Probably fast.
Scientifically correct. Slow makes me
fall asleep.
Slow makes you falling asleep.
Yeah.
Don't go slow. Definitely.
And whenever whenever anyone says, "Oh,
slow show is so loving and meaningful."
I'm
yourself. I'm bored.
I'm asleep. I definitely say like fast
is more fun. So maybe like that.
But if like they're just doing their job
and they're not doing the job for me,
then I'm like, "Okay, no." You know,
fast pumps stuff.
Okay.
Fast pumps.
Yeah. Fast fast pumps.
Slow.
Slow pumps. Okay.
Slow pumps.
Slow pumps.
Yeah. Yeah.
Why slow pumps make you moan louder?
Because I I told you it takes time to to
reach the you know what you want to
find. Honestly, neither.
Neither.
Honestly, neither.
No longer. I
feel like I fake it the whole time.
Do you dear?
I need to find better men.
Yeah.
Okay,
that's the moral of the story.
Yeah, most of the time I'm just faking
it. It's like, okay, pretend like you
like it for them.
Why fast pumps makes you moan louder?
It's more intense. I don't know. Cuz
it's going fast.
It's the fast.
Yeah, it's just it's just going fast.
Like so much things happen. So just you
don't know how to proceed. So you just
make sounds.
It looks like slow is more romantic,
fast is more intense.
Yeah, he's just really loud.
