I had heard about this Caitlyn Clark and
I was like watching videos of her just
like having like 40 points like
averaging a million in high school
>> and I was like, "Oh, this girl thinks
she's going to come here and rule the
world, you know, like whatever. It's
going to be, you know, whatever." And
there she did came in right away and
ruled the world. And I was like, "All
right, here we go."
>> Kate Martin's WNBA journey started with
promise, but quickly turned into a
nightmare. The former Iowa standout, the
same one who helped Caitlyn Clark lead
the Hawkeyes to back-to-back final
fours, found herself wasting away on the
Las Vegas Aces bench, watching her
career stall before it even had a chance
to start. Game after game, her minutes
vanished, her confidence slipped, and
the franchise that was supposed to
develop her seemed content to let her
fade. Then came a phone call that
changed everything from Caitlyn Clark
herself. In a new interview, Kate opened
up about the exact moment she realized
Vegas wasn't her home, the conversation
with Caitlyn that reignited her fire,
and why joining the Golden State
Valkyries became more than a move. It
became a rebirth. If you're rooting for
Kate, you know what to do. Type Golden
State Kate in the comments.
>> I feel like your two Iowa teams left a
mark on women's college basketball, but
also women's basketball at large. Is
that like kind of crazy to think about?
like you were a part of something that
was a catalyst for this like larger
growth.
>> To understand how we got here, you've
got to rewind to Iowa. Before Caitlyn
Clark and Kate Martin turned Carver
Hawkeye Arena into a mad house, Iowa
women's basketball wasn't even on the
national radar. But those two flipped
the script. Every home game became a
spectacle. Not because of hype, but
because of how they played. Caitlyn was
the Flash, the logo threes, the viral
highlights. Kate was the foundation, the
one making everything run smoothly
behind the scenes. She wasn't the
sidekick, she was the system.
>> I just remember you have that summer
before and she was doing things that I
had never seen anybody do before. And as
a freshman to come in and have that kind
of confidence like not everybody has
that like I I was like, "Oh, I I haven't
really seen anything like this." And so,
um, we knew she was going to be
outstanding. And then yeah, the
beginning of the year we had some big
wins and there was highs and lows that
year for sure, but um you know it took
us a little bit to figure it out, but
yeah, it obviously turned out better
than I could have ever expected or
thought.
>> Let's talk about those final four runs
in 2023 and 2024. Sure, everyone
remembers Caitlyn dropping 40 and
breaking scoring records, but look
deeper. Kate Martin averaged 13.1 points
and nearly seven rebounds a game. Those
are not roleplayer numbers. Those are
leader numbers. But Kate had the rare
maturity to understand that her greatest
strength wasn't outshining Caitlyn. It
was elevating her. She was the glue, the
balance, the quiet power that made the
whole machine work.
>> Real quick, what did you notice about
Caitlyn's like work ethic?
>> Was there anything that stood out?
>> Yeah, absolutely. I mean, she was in the
gym constantly and it was like the way
she approached everything too was like
>> it was like with a sort of excellence.
It wasn't like, oh, I'm just going to go
through the motions and like whatever.
It was like, no, like I'm here to kick
your butt. And every single drill, every
single practice like and especially
whenever our like gray squad guys were
playing against us, it was like if
you're across from me, you're my enemy,
you know? And like I think that's just
kind of how you have to approach things
to get better. And she had that, you
know, next level mindset and it really
just raised us all up with her. Go back
and watch that iconic final four matchup
against South Carolina, the one that
stunned the undefeated Gamecocks. Kate
calls it the defining moment of her
career, and it's easy to see why. She
was everywhere, communicating, boxing
out, cutting off lanes, setting screens.
She was the calm amid chaos. When Clark
needed space to create, Kate was the one
clearing it. When teammates got rattled,
she was the voice that steadied them.
That's leadership you can't teach and
the kind of presence that wins
championships.
>> If you had to pick like kind of like a
favorite highlight, like getting to the
final four, is it beating South Carolina
and breaking their streak? Is it, you
know, getting to the final game? Like
what would have been the moment?
>> I would say beating South South Carolina
was like
>> that was incredible. That was like the
best moment ever cuz like
we like all believed that we could make
it to a final four and so we were just
like all right we made it to a final
four like let's go this is great. We
didn't think we were gonna really make
it to the national championship. Like
the undefeated South Car, you know,
South Carolina, they're like Twin Towers
down there, like just a very long,
athletic, good team.
>> And so when we like executed that game,
plan perfectly, and beat them. That was
probably one of the that's like still
probably my career highlight.
>> But the real magic between Caitlyn and
Kate wasn't just chemistry. It was
telepathy. These two shared a basketball
wavelength.
Kate knew exactly when to crash the
boards for Caitlyn's missed threes. And
Caitlyn instinctively found Kate for
open looks or hockey assists that set up
teammates. They weren't just teammates,
they were an ecosystem. Caitlyn's
confidence thrived because Kate made the
game easier. Kate's impact soared
because Caitlyn trusted her completely.
>> Yeah, I feel like like looking back on
it and then even just talking to you
now, it's like yes, Caitlyn is like a
big focal point of the team. She's going
to have to do a lot of the scoring, all
the things. And you, it's almost like
good cop bad cop or something.
>> I don't mean it in like literal terms,
but she just had to like be herself and
that was going to win you games, but
then you had to come in and kind of be
like a calming
>> effect and that. So, I'm actually really
curious as these teams start to take
shape in 2023 and then 2024, like what
was your leadership style in conjunction
with a player like Caitlyn, but also the
rest of your teammate?
>> And make no mistake, Kate did the dirty
work that didn't make it into the
highlight reels. She set the screens
that freed Caitlyn for those impossible
shots. She rotated defensively to cover
for Caitlyn's aggressive gamles. She
grabbed the offensive rebounds that gave
Iowa second chances.
>> I was definitely more of like the calmer
presence and being like, "Hey, like look
me in the eyes, you know, deep breath,
like it's all going to be okay." And I
think like the leadership style that I
really had was just like trust. Like she
trusted me cuz she had seen me like
putting in the work in the gym. She had
she knew how much I cared. like I wasn't
I was only 2 years older than her, but
like she she believed that like I had
her best interest in mind and like I
showed her that over and over again.
Like I built a relationship with her
outside of basketball. I built you know
I tried to build relationships with all
my teammates outside of basketball. So
it wasn't like the only time I'm talking
to you is out on the court and telling
you like hey like can't do that or like
hey like do the you know whatever. It's
like
>> it's called relationship equity.
>> Exactly. The reason the Hawkeyes were
feared wasn't just because they had a
superstar. It's because they had the
perfect partner to back her up.
>> Like if we needed to get across to
Caitlyn, you know, like it was like
Kate, like that was like my job at
times. And then like her junior and
sophomore year, like she had done so
much like work on herself and like how
to be like a great teammate and all of
us together that like I really I didn't
need to like I don't know like do all of
that. Yeah.
But I felt grateful that you know she
trusted me enough
to where it was relates
and I felt grateful that like I was the
person who could speak up.
>> But the WNBA is a different beast. Kate
thought that Iowa Magic, that blend of
chemistry, toughness, and IQ would
seamlessly carry over to the pros.
Instead, she hit a brick wall in Las
Vegas. The Aces drafted her. But what
came next felt like a slow motion
demotion. While Ajaw Wilson and the Aces
veteran core hogged every meaningful
minute, Kate sat and watched her dream
fade. Her playing time tells the story.
In May, she averaged about 20 minutes
per game, respectable for a rookie. By
September, just 11.5.
Her production cratered to 2.6 points,
1.6 and six rebounds. Those aren't
numbers that reflect lack of talent.
They reflect lack of opportunity. The
same player who was pulling down boards
and knocking down shots in college was
now being told to grab a towel and stay
ready for what exactly.
>> Like you you really do, but like it's
just hard as you know. Like it's there's
only 12 spots, whatever.
>> And when the playoffs rolled around,
things somehow got worse. Six playoff
games, three total minutes. Three.
That's not player development. That's a
message. And the message was clear. In
Vegas, Kate Martin wasn't part of the
plan.
>> I'm curious. So, now that you are into
your second year, like what do you
think?
>> What makes the WNBA so difficult to play
in?
>> Man, I mean, I just think the
physicality,
>> speed, smart players, like really smart
players. Um, and people who have been
around for so long, honestly.
Uh
yeah, I mean I'm just thinking back to
like New York. They're massive. They
are, you know, like
>> Yeah, they're very very very good. Like
uh a lot of these people have been
playing professional basketball for a
very long time.
>> Subird, a legend who's seen it all, once
described how brutal that transition can
be. The WNBA's speed, physicality, and
complexity humble even the most
decorated college stars. Bird's words
hit like prophecy in Kate's case. Only
this wasn't just a learning curve. This
was a dead end.
>> Scoring is not easy. Like people who
average like however many point like
>> it's honestly so impressive. Like I've
never been more impressed by basketball
than like now. Like
>> basketball is a simple game, but that
doesn't mean it's easy. It's an easy
game.
>> Um
>> but yeah, like it people work really
hard. They are long, they're big,
they're fast, they're physical. Um, so
me just like having to learn how to be
patient,
>> play off of two feet, play in in
control. Um, that is something, you
know, I'm still working on cuz sometimes
you're like trying to do the right thing
always and like make the right read, but
then you forget like, hey, just go play
basketball.
>> The AC's structure guaranteed it.
Veterans like Wilson and Chelsea Gray
controlled the rotation and coach Becky
Hammond wasn't about to disrupt her
pecking order. Rookies weren't nurtured,
they were placeholders. Kate wasn't
competing for minutes against peers. She
was trying to break into a dynasty that
didn't have room for anyone new. It
wasn't about her skill, it was about her
situation, and that's what stung the
most. Every game Kate sat out felt like
watching her career disappear in real
time. Every practice where she ran the
scout team felt like punishment for
believing she could belong. The
confidence she built at Iowa was being
stripped away, not by her performance,
but by politics.
>> It's because it's really, really hard to
come off the bench in what is a version
of limited minutes compared to starters.
It's not always that case, but you get
my point. In a limited amount of time
and be really impactful.
>> Yeah,
>> that is one of I think the hardest
things. And anytime I've been around a
teammate who's been able to do that, it
I just it at times it's more impressive
than than the star player who just has
that ultra green light. And you've kind
of already brought up the balance.
>> The cruel truth she discovered.
>> The WNBA doesn't just test your ability,
it tests your timing. It doesn't matter
how good you are if you're in the wrong
system with the wrong coach. Talent
can't bloom when it's buried. And in Las
Vegas, under Ajaw Wilson's shadow and
behind the AC's bloated hierarchy, Kate
Martin wasn't being developed, she was
being ignored. There was one phone call
that changed everything for Kate Martin.
A single conversation that rescued her
career from disappearing in Las Vegas.
At her lowest point, sitting on the AC's
bench and questioning whether she even
belonged in the WNBA, Kate did what she
always did when she needed clarity. She
called Caitlyn Clark. How did you feel
about the whole expansion draft
situation?
>> I was really excited.
>> Okay. So, when you weren't protected,
were you like kind of expecting that and
then it was like whatever happens
happens.
>> Yeah, I was kind of expecting that. I
mean, you just looked at the roster and
you were like, there's just like too
many good players. It's a business.
Like, okay.
>> You know, like it is what it is.
>> It wasn't just a friendly chat. It was
the lifeline she didn't know she needed.
>> Caitlyn was dealing with her own brutal
learning curve in Indiana. the
physicality, the speed, the pressure of
being the face of an entire league. But
when Kate explained how she was being
buried in Vegas, Caitlyn instantly
recognized what was wrong. It wasn't
Kate's talent. It was her environment.
Caitlyn told her exactly what no one
else had the courage to say, "You're not
failing, they're failing you."
>> Up until then, I didn't know if I had
been protected or not.
>> Okay.
>> And so,
>> Oh, yeah. That's right. They don't
actually.
>> They told some people, but they didn't.
I was not involved. No, it's actually
smart they don't tell cuz I would just
be
>> Yeah,
>> that'd be messed up.
>> Yeah. And so I
Yeah. When I got told I was going to get
picked up, I was just super excited for
another opportunity. Like some people
don't get opportunities to go to a
training camp or like, you know, get the
opportunity to make a team. Um, and so
the fact that I knew I was going to get
another shot, I was excited and uh felt
really grateful for it. So yeah, I was I
was really happy.
>> That hit home. Caitlyn reminded her of
what they built together at Iowa, a
partnership built on trust, chemistry,
and understanding each other's
strengths. She told Kate that sometimes
success isn't about grinding harder in a
bad situation. It's about finding a
place that sees your worth. That single
phone call reframed everything. Leaving
Vegas wasn't quitting. It was choosing
herself. Sue Bird once said that every
player needs to find the right system.
Not just any team, but the one that
actually values what they bring. That
was the light bulb moment for Kate. When
the Golden State Valkyries selected her
in the expansion draft, it wasn't just
another roster move. It was an
invitation to start over. Vegas saw her
as disposable. Golden State saw her as
foundational.
>> Now you're in the Bay. It's a new
franchise.
>> Season tickets were sold out
immediately. I've heard home games are
insane. The owners have come out. They
said a chip within the first 5 years.
So, the expectations are high. Um, but
like you said, it was an opportunity to
make a team and and you did. So, what
has that excitement of a new franchise
been like?
>> The Valkyries knew exactly what they
were getting. A leader, a communicator,
and a player who could shape a team's
culture before ever taking a shot. I'm
really excited, Kate said in her first
interview. This league is all about
opportunity, and you just need one shot.
That line summed it up perfectly.
Caitlyn gave her the courage to bet on
herself and Golden State gave her the
table to place that bet on. That phone
call didn't just save her career. It
reignited her belief that she belonged.
But let's be clear, this move is bigger
than just a change of uniform. It's a
full reset, the kind you only get once
in a career. Expansion teams are rare
chances to build something from the
ground up. And that's exactly what Kate
needed, a blank canvas where she could
define her own story.
>> It's been awesome. It's got to be
insane.
>> Yeah, it's been awesome. Like the fans
really are so loud.
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah, it it has been awesome in Chase
Center. Um and they they've been
sticking with it the whole game. Like
when we were losing to LA the first
game, they stayed the entire time and
they cheered us on from the first minute
to the last minute. And so that means a
lot as a team like
>> seeing your fans stay like
>> and cheer for you. They were invested.
Uh it was just really cool. And like you
see people in the Bay Area just wearing
Valkyries gear all the time.
>> Unlike Las Vegas, Golden State isn't
built on egos and hierarchy. The Aces
were a topheavy franchise run by stars
who guarded their minutes like gold, led
by Asia Wilson, whose dominance left no
room for anyone else to shine. In
contrast, the Valkyries are building
something collaborative. Their GM Ohan
made it clear she wanted players who
could set the tone. unselfish, high IQ
athletes who valued chemistry over
clout. Kate was her prototype. Head
coach Natalie Nass, who had seen Kate's
work ethic up close in Vegas,
immediately shifted gears. Her approach
in Golden State is about effort and
intent, not perfection. Mistakes aren't
punishable. Complacency is. She preaches
communication, enthusiasm, and
accountability. Everything Kate brings
naturally. The message was clear in this
system. Your energy matters.
>> It just feels really cool to be part of
that history, a part of something so
new. And we obviously know it's going to
be like a huge learning year for us, but
uh I'm grateful to do it with all of the
the girls on this roster.
>> And that's exactly what was missing in
Vegas. Under the A's star-driven
dynamic, rookies like Kate were
invisible. In Golden State, she's not a
backup plan. She's part of the
blueprint. Her role to anchor the team
culture with her trademark work ethic to
bring that same Iowa glue energy, the
grit, the calm, the unselfishness that
helped Caitlyn Clark thrive on the
court. Her focus is simple but vital.
Rebound hard, defend relentlessly, make
smart passes, and hit open shots. She's
not chasing highlight stats. She's
building trust. Every possession, every
hustle play, every box out is her
statement to the league that she
belongs. And this time she's got the
minutes and system to prove it. People's
focus is just like here with us and like
whatever happened happened. But yeah, I
mean I think in ways people can be like,
"Man, I didn't get protected." like as
like an athlete, you know, it's it's
kind of hard not to be like, oh, they
didn't want me, you know, like
>> or like kind of feels like a failure in
some type of way or like rejection maybe
is a better word.
>> Um, but it everybody's like energy,
everybody's excite excitement to get
better and to learn and to build each
other up has been phenomenal.
>> Subird's wisdom about finding your fit
is unfolding in real time here. Golden
State is giving Kate exactly what Vegas
refused to, space to grow. It's proof
that the right environment can unlock
talent in ways no stat sheet can
capture. The Valkyries didn't just hand
Kate Martin a role. They handed her a
purpose. She's helping shape a brand new
franchise from day one. And that kind of
influence is rare in professional
sports. It's not just about winning
games. It's about building identity, one
that values hard work, connection, and
belief. Kate's move mirrors a familiar
truth in sports. Sometimes the most
powerful career decision isn't staying
loyal, but walking away. Every athlete
faces that moment when they realize
they've outgrown their surroundings. For
Kate, leaving the Aces wasn't a failure.
It was her declaration of independence.
I really love it. Honestly, it's it's
been a lot of fun. But yeah, they
brought a like a crazy spark. Like they
very high IQ, like want to play fast. Um
and yeah, they just get out and go go
go. And so, um that's how we want to
play too. You know, we want to play fast
and we want to, you know, as you guys
have probably can see with the numbers,
we want to shoot a lot of threes, too.
And so, uh their experience, like, yeah,
they're young, but they they've been
playing pro for
>> way more like a really long time. So, um
they have a lot of experience and
they've brought a lot of fun to the to
the team, for sure. She's not the first
player to thrive after a change of
scenery, and she won't be the last. But
her journey feels different because we
all watch the rise, the fall, and now
the rebirth. From the heights of Iowa to
the depths of Vegas, Kate's story was
always about resilience. And now in
Golden State, it's about redemption. The
Golden State Valkyries are betting on
her leadership. Caitlyn Clark reminded
her of her worth. and Kate Martin. She's
proving that sometimes the smartest
thing you can do is stop waiting for
opportunity and go create it yourself.
So next time you see her wearing that
Valkyy's jersey, remember what it took
to get there. The long nights on the
bench, the frustration, the one phone
call that turned everything around. This
isn't just a comeback. It's a
masterclass in self-belief. If you're
rooting for her, you know what to do.
