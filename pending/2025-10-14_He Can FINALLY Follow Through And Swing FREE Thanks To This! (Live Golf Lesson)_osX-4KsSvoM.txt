Now coming through. Let it shallow out.
Turning through. Keep turning. Keep
turning. I want you to let the energy
out. And see how long this whole system
is.
I want you to feel like it's long right
here.
There you go. You got to keep turning
and let that whole thing lengthen out
out front.
Hello.
Yeah, that was better.
Uh-huh.
Easy.
Oh, that was really good. Check it out.
It's the best swing I've ever seen. Can
you make right there? Follow through
exit would look like that. It's really
good.
Like look at that.
It feels Yeah, it feels a lot easier.
Keep hitting a few. I'm going to shoot a
few videos of you.
Like the mechanics of how his body is
moving are
a lot closer than what they once were.
Come look at it. The grip and setup look
good.
The windup looks pretty good. Except
when I look at
this view, hands work a little out.
And then they do an interesting like you
create depth a little late and you don't
really get your right wrist very loaded.
Let me check something. How much can you
do this? Oh, you got plenty. You don't
do it. Which then because this never
hinges the the center of mass of that
club can never get far enough back. So,
as you're swinging out, the club kind of
goes over your tumbles over your hands a
little bit. You turn out of the way a
lot better than you once were. See how
much longer your arms are than they used
to be.
Oh, yeah.
You're using your your legs to kind of
create more of a posting up than you
used to kind of get sucked into it like
that. Remember? So, it's definitely
better. My focus is for right now, I
want to have you really feeling like
you're almost making that hand work this
way in the back swing. See what I'm
doing?
Yep.
Cuz you're standing the club up, but
you're doing it by kind of moving your
whole arm unit up. Does that make sense?
Yeah.
Versus just getting that to load.
Yeah. I think I was I was kind of trying
to f, you know, more inside.
Yeah. And then I was trying to go more
up so I wasn't hinging.
Yeah. I like in up, but really let's
we're going to give you the feel of
loading those wrists, getting the hinge
set. So that's going to be a lot more
powerful for you. So let's do some some
drills where we we create a little bit
more stood up golf club and then a
little bit more of a feel of a long arc
through the golf ball. Do you know what
I mean when I say long arc through the
golf ball? I'll show you real fast. Can
I borrow that?
So you're going to you're the
combination of things. is we're going to
feel this standing up and then it's
going to feel like the center of mass
creates just a little fall back and
we're going to trace as much
arc out front here as we can. So see how
my body has to move to be able to do
that. If I go this way, I can't get that
to be long cuz if I make it long, it's
going into the earth.
Mhm. So,
I'm going to have to keep turning
like this to make my arms have room to
be long.
Does that make sense?
Yeah.
Okay. So, let's just go slow for a
second. Really exaggerate the standing
up of the golf club and then letting it
lay down a little bit. So, you're going
to start winding it back to me and then
we're going to feel
how I've loaded that wrist a little bit.
And I keep turning up.
Now, from there, you you have a nice
little fall down. So, we're going to
start to fall down. Feel where the club
is right there, kind of behind your
hands. Now, you can just keep turning
and extending up through it. And your
arms can get really long like this. So,
I want to see you do that on your own.
Slow motion. No ball.
Okay. Good.
Good. Now all one flow.
Okay. I want you to finish it right
here.
Long arms out front.
Beautiful. You know what that feels
like?
Yeah. I shouldn't be I shouldn't be
rolling the club in here. I should just
be
not not in this The club's going to do
some of the things you want it to do
where it kind of unloads when there's
momentum to it. But in in this drill, I
don't need you to add anything.
Flip should be back like that.
It's going to feel like it's
up, but feel how this wrist is hinged.
Okay. Turning it back. And we're getting
that right wrist loaded into a fairly
significant amount of trail wrist
extension.
You didn't have hardly any of that. Now,
I need to make sure that your hands stay
on correctly because when you're doing
that, something's happening in your So,
see how the my right hand looks right
here? My thumb's closed. I create this
little notch right here. It should be
like right there like that. The club as
you're hinging it should kind of put
pressure into this notch. Feel that?
Yeah.
And we don't want any of that breaking
apart. So, it's got to, if we're going
to have really good control of the face,
we have to have good control of what's
happening here in our hands. It can't
get sloppy.
And I can just go up.
Uhhuh. Just turn it up. So, show me all
one motion. I got to make sure it looks
right without a ball before we throw a
ball in the way.
All one motion.
No follow through.
There you go. Okay. Do that again. I
want to record it and see if it looks
right.
Give me one more.
Okay, now just chip a ball like that.
Like literally just that exact motion.
Holy cow. Who was that? That was
different. Do it again.
Son of a gun.
Where it's really different is what
happens out in the front.
Nice.
Wow.
But when he has this hinge, then he can
have more of this hinge.
Yeah. Those those go together. You if
you don't have very much trail wrist
extension, you can't have hip flexion.
Historically, your hooks are are not
happening because you have a shut face.
They're happening because your body got
in the way and you flipped your hands at
it.
Like that's so much better.
It feels easy. It feels less arms. It
feels
I think the this the key was getting
your wrists to do the right thing.
Yeah, that's good.
Okay. Now, if we start seeing a little
low left one like that, we just need to
make sure your right arm stays under a
little bit better.
Oh, versus
like that.
Yeah. So, get get back up there. Wind it
up.
Now, we're going to change directions.
Start unwinding. So, your right arm is
more under there. Now, just clear this
out of the way. Right arm stays under
longer.
That won't go left. What happens? You
got the face in a good spot here. Now,
this just stops a little bit. The right
arm starts to to come out. Now, where's
the face?
Yeah. Yeah.
Left.
Good.
There you go.
Not left.
Not left.
Now, let's do it a little bigger than
that.
Better. All the way up. All the way up.
Now once we've created this now the feel
that little supenation
on the last one. The reason it went left
is you got it to here and then you went
this way
just slightly.
There you go. Keep it standing up
longer. All the way up. Turn it all the
way up. Keep it standing up. And then
let it start to fall. So it's standing
up. Standing up. Now as you change
directions
it falls back. Stays back. Keep cranking
your chest out of the way. And then
create a long arc through the ball.
Okay, it's really close. It's good.
So, you're getting much better at the
loading the wrists on the back swing.
Keep winding.
Now, coming through. So, let it shallow
out. Turning through. Keep turning. Keep
turning. I want you to let the energy
out and see how long this whole system
is.
I want you to feel like it's long right
here.
Don't let it Don't let your chest be
down in the club over here.
There you go. You got to keep turning
and let that whole thing lengthen out
out front.
Hello.
Yeah, that was better.
Uh-huh.
Like that's that's not just better.
That's
feel good.
That's better.
Feel
That's
It felt easy.
Oh, that was really good. Check it out.
It's the best swing I've ever seen you
make right there.
That's a statement. Oh, yeah. That was
Look at the space you have. You haven't
jammed your right leg out into the ball.
Club follows. See this arc the club's
following around.
Yeah.
Woo. Who's that man?
Yeah, that was I I actually I agree with
you.
That's the best swing I've ever seen you
make. By quite a bit, actually. If we
showed you before and after with your
head, like that was
What's that? You remember your head
where it was like
it was like down.
Oh, it was forever. No, you're moving.
You're free. If you would if if you
could have told me the very first lesson
I gave you that your impact would look
like or your follow-through exit would
look like that. It's really good.
Like look at that.
It feels Yeah, it feels a lot easier.
So, I think a lot of your body's
reaction was reacting to what your hands
had to do to hit the ball just because
just based on how your wrist worked and
us focusing more on just loading the
wrist better, clean up a lot of other
stuff. Hey everyone, thanks for
