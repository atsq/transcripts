Thank you very much everybody. Please,
this is such an honor. This is the uh
Please be seated.
Sit the [ __ ] down.
This is the first time we've
relax
been at the new and improved Rose Garden
and people are loving it. They're loving
it like they've not loved a lot of
things. We have the presidential walk of
fame which you just saw and uh it just
opened and we wanted to get it open for
this occasion. We were hoping we were
able to get outside and the weather
allowed us to. It was supposed to be
terrible rainy day. I was telling Eric
second in
God was watching and he didn't want that
for Charlie. He just didn't want that.
So uh it's really uh beautiful. It
couldn't couldn't be more beautiful.
Today we're here to honor and remember
warrior for liberty, beloved leader who
galvanized
the next generation like nobody I've
ever seen before.
And an American patriot of the deepest
conviction,
the finest quality and the highest
caliber,
the late great Charlie Kirk.
Less orange than earlier. Five weeks
ago, our nation was robbed of this
extraordinary champion. He was a
champion in every way. I got to know him
so well. He didn't like losing
and he was able to fight people that
were enemies and he didn't necessarily
love those enemies so much. You know, I
heard I heard he loved his enemies and I
said, "Wait a minute. Is that the same
Charlie that I know?" I'm not sure. But
I didn't want to get into it.
But it was a horrible heinous
the debate with Charlie Kirk and Hassan.
He was assassinated in the prime of his
life for boldly speaking the truth for
living his faith and relentlessly
fighting for a better and stronger
America. He loved this country. And
that's why this afternoon, it's my
privilege to posumously
award Charles James Kirk, our nation's
highest civilian honor, the Presidential
Medal of Freedom. Thank you.
As you know, only hours ago, I returned
from a very historic trip to secure
peace in the Middle East. I heard about
that.
Said that couldn't be done. Charlie felt
it could be done.
Charlie felt it could be done.
Well,
thank you.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Thank you very much. But I raced back
halfway around the globe. I was going to
call Erica and say, "Erica, could you
maybe move it to Friday?"
And I didn't have the courage to call.
But you know why I didn't call? Because
I heard today was Charlie's birthday.
And I said, 'You know, now we that was a
definite. And I said, 'We going to have
to forget about some of those very big,
very rich countries that expected me to
be there. And I can tell you based on
the length of that flight, I wouldn't
want to go back tomorrow.
Geez.
But I would not have missed this moment
for anything in the world. Nothing. And
it's a very important time for our
country. And our country is doing so
well. It's never done better.
We are a country with almost now 18
trillion dollars of investment coming
in. Nobody's ever seen anything like
that. Previous administration had less
than a trillion for four years. We have
more than 18. It'll be much more than 20
by the time the year. More than 20
trillion dollars. There's never been a
country in the world that had anything
like that. What's happened to our
country is incredible. In a short period
of time, Charlie was a big person for
Sir, could we close up those borders,
please? A little bit.
Oh, yeah. I remember that. Really? That
was a big problem. Said, Charlie, I
haven't gotten there yet.
But, you know, it came out last four
months.
Literally nobody was allowed into our
country.
And that's right. The only people that
were allowed in were people that came in
legally. The borders are absolutely
stone cold closed. and uh they reported
zero zero zero and zero. So that's
pretty good. But he was a a big
believer. He wanted people in the
country more than I did, frankly. He
wanted them to come in legally and he
got his wish. October 14th is Charlie's
birthday and he
that's today
should have been turning 32 years old. I
tell you I never when I first met him he
was like 22 and I said boy he's awfully
young but I thought he was older than
that you know he looked a little bit
older than his age that's okay you know
that's not good when you're old but when
you're young it's great he had the best
of all things but he was special but
instead Charlie is attaining a far more
important hairline yeah
entering his name forever into the
eternal roster
of true American heroes He's a true
American hero, an amazing person way,
way beyond his years.
And I'm honored to be joined by a woman
who has endured unspeakable hardship
with unbelievable
strength. And that's Charlie's
widow, Erica. And I just want to thank
you, Erica. He loved you so much.
I was with him. Please.
Thank you, darling.
Thank you,
man.
I was with him before I met Erica and he
told me he was going to get married. He
said, "You won't believe how beautiful
she is." I said, "Well, then now that I
meet her," he was right. But then he
also said, "And you know what? She's
like the smartest person I know." See,
they do go together on occasion. Not
often. Not often, but on occasion they
go together. But uh he was he was in
love with you. He was deeply in love
with you. It's great.
Erica, your love and courage have been
an inspiration to all of us. And we will
always be here for you and we're always
going to be here for your gorgeous
president
and we'll never forget what your family
has sacrificed
for our country. man loved our country.
When things were going badly for our
country, he was so,
as you know, angry. He would say it
doesn't have to be.
Usually women are either hot or smart.
We're also pleased joined by an
incredible group of Charlie's
friends. Very powerful friends actually,
and some not so powerful, and they're
actually better people. Okay, I know
them all. They're the less powerful
ones. I have to tell you that all of you
guys down here, the best ones in the
group are the ones that are less
successful, but that happens to
No, they're all great. And they're here.
And let's start with Erica's father.
Where is Erica's father? Where are you?
One of a kind president.
Dead. Oh, look at him. Wow. I want to
get a hat like that, too. I like that.
Let me guess.
How are you? Nice to see you again.
It It's It's the hat of him.
Vice President J. D. Vance, who's been
fantastic. JD, thank you very much.
Great. Doing a great job. Did a great
job on Sunday.
2028 hat. Yeah.
With George Slapadopoulos. That's it.
Sloppolis.
Good.
Second lady who's a phenomenal woman.
Oh god.
Vance. Thank you very much.
Slopp.
Thank you very much.
That's a good one.
Great woman.
President of Argentina. He wanted to be
here. That that's Argentine is a serious
flight, right? And he's become a
superstar and he's doing amazing things.
Rock president.
It's uh he's a MAGA person, but it's
make Argentina great again. That's what
he does, right?
Oh, wow.
And I want you to stand, please. Javier
Javier Mle
doing a great job.
Thank you very much. Many members of my
cabinet are here. Just about all of them
are here. I won't go into every single
one of them, but I'll announce a few of
the people that have really turned this
country around and helped me. Incredible
people.
Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson.
Where is Mike? Mike,
what a job you're doing, Mike.
What a job.
What a job you're doing.
What a job.
I watched you this morning and you're in
there trying to say, "Look, just let the
country open. Everything will be fine."
grandpa doing this.
We're dealing with some radical
left lunatics
and I just wish Charlie was here to
fight us. I think the fight would have
been over already.
He would have had a march on the capital
by people who whose average age is about
21 because there's nobody that
had that relationship with young people,
right, Mike? So, thank you, Mike, for
being here. House Majority Leader Steve
Scaliz.
Thank you very much.
Brave, a brave guy and a friend.
Oh, God.
House Majority Whip. Another terrific
man.
Tom Emmer.
Yeah.
Um,
thank you, Tom. Senate Majority Whip.
John Baraso. John, thank you very much.
You have all these senators. I'm going
to get in trouble. I'm not going to read
all their names. I'll be reading all
day. We'll be talking about Charlie in
about 45 minutes from now. We can't do
that. So all of the senators, so many of
you,
thank you very much. I do want to thank
Senator Shu Thun for doing
a terrific job. He's really been leading
properly. Do you agree, Mike? The team,
the two of these guys have been
fantastic. So to Senator Thun, I want to
thank you very much. Incredible job.
Watched him this morning and he was out
there pounding them this morning on
television, too.
Oh,
and John Baraso, thank you for the work
you've done and congratulations on your
success. But I want to thank you all and
all of the Congress people that are here
and I see we have our attorney general
here. So, and you are doing a fantastic
job. Thank you very much, Pam.
But are you But is she though? Like,
thank you very much.
But is she like
We have everybody. Wow.
I mean, but really though,
okay, I'm not going to do anymore.
Going to be here too long. But I just
want to thank you have given him such
support, but he always gave you such
support. That's why you're here. and uh
very unusual
a visionary and calm down one of the
greatest figures of his generation. He
was truly amazing figure
and and growing leaps and bounds. He
knew that the fight to preserve our
heritage is waged not only on the
battlefield and in the halls of power of
which we have tremendous power here
including
the head of a place called war. We call
it now war. We had defense. We had our
secretary of defense. Now we have a
secretary of war.
And somehow I think it's more
emblematic. And hopefully we'll never
have to use war. But the fact that we're
ready is very good. Peace through
strength is very important. But also in
the hearts of our nation's youth. That's
where Charlie rode strongest at age 18.
That insight inspired Charlie to found
the organization that ultimately touched
the lives of millions and millions of
people and so many young people. that
nobody's ever seen anything like it,
frankly. Turning Point USA. It's
amazing. And it's actually bigger now.
It's become bigger in the last few weeks
than Charlie ever thought.
I think his end vision in many years
from now would have been just a fraction
of what it turned out to be in a couple
of weeks. Right. It's amazing. with hard
work and joyful spirit and endless
enthusiasm and determination.
And he did have great enthusiasm. You
know, I always say you need enthusiasm
to be successful. He had great
enthusiasm. Charlie grew turning point
into the largest conservative youth
organization in the entire country. He
forged a personal bond with countless
young conservatives. He fought for free
speech, religious liberty, strong
borders, and a very strong and proud
America. In everything he did, he put
America first. He really put America
first.
And ultimately, Charlie became more than
a leader of an important organization.
He became the leader of historic
movements all over the country. There
were movements, individual movements,
one movement, but it was historic.
Everything he did was historic. and back
a true evangelist for the cause of
freedom. And
the word of almighty God, God was very
important to Charlie. He would say, you
know, if you don't have religion, you're
not going to have a strong country. It's
true. He was so wise beyond his years.
You know, I talk to him sometimes. I
say, "This guy is like a young guy." He
was really a wise man. From the time
Charlie worked on my presidential
campaign in 2016, and he was there right
from the beginning. He liked me. I don't
know. I have no idea why.
What the hell was he thinking?
He said, "You're going to win, sir." I
said, "You know, I'm running against 17
senators and a lot of tough people and
governors. We have all these people."
And he said, "No, you're going to win,
sir." He said, "Not going to be close."
And he made it happen. He helped make it
happen. I'll tell you that without him,
who knows what would be. Maybe you'd
have Kamala standing here today. That
would not be good. I will tell you
Javier, you don't know who Kamla is.
Promise it would not be good. You agree
with that Howard?
He also mobilized countless citizens to
go vote. It's called go vote. Very
simple.
And with his help in 2024, we won more
young people than any Republican by far
in the history of our country.
And we won the popular vote. We won the
swing states. All seven of them. I
remember they said, "Oh, well, if Trump
could win four, that would be nice." I
win seven by a lot, by a landslide.
Wow.
But the popular vote was massive.
That's a lot.
And uh we won the electoral college.
Remember, they said, "Well, it's going
to be very hard. I'd say 270." Well, we
got 312 to 226. He's going to talk about
how
we won something called districts and
councils and different things. But in
one case, we won 2,750
to 525.
That's the one where you see the map is
almost entirely red except they have a
little blue line on one side and a
little blue line meaning New York and a
little bit Los Angeles. And I have a
feeling that if the v vote were 100% we
would have won that too. You want to
know the truth? But he knew and he knew
very well and he also understood honesty
and he was always concerned with
honesty. He said the only way we can
lose is if the cheating gets so bad and
that's where we came up with a little
phrase
too big to rig.
We said go out and vote.
Just go out and vote. And we had that
remember we used to say that all the
time because people would say oh they're
going to win. We don't have to vote.
Let's go to a movie. We'll come home and
watch later. and he wasn't about that.
So, we had we come up to with really
together we came up with that phrase, we
got to make it too big. I never made a
speech where I didn't say at the end,
now look,
the polls are showing good. Don't
believe the polls. He said, we're going
to make it Susie, right? Too big to rig.
So, if you think we're going to win by
doesn't matter. Pretend we're losing.
You got to go out and vote. They voted.
It's probably a good way to do it.
902 the whole thing was over, right?
902.
That was a blowout.
They said, "Oh, this could go a few
days." Well, went a few minutes 9:02.
And he knew that. And I I felt it, but
he knew it. He knew it. I think he knew
it more than anybody. But Charlie never
missed an opportunity to remind us of
the Judeo-Christian principles of our
nation's founding or to share his deep
Christian faith. In his final moments,
Charlie testified to the greatness of
America and to the glory of our savior
with whom he now rests in heaven. And he
is going to make heaven. And I said,
"I'm not sure I can make it, but he's
going to make it." He's there. He's
looking down on us right now. It's so
incredible. Look at this. How this
turned out. This was supposed to be so
dark and cloudy.
Not dark and cloudy, is it? Look at
that. How beautiful.
You found out. Yeah.
There's no artist that can can capture
it as beautiful as it is today. Wow.
Uhhuh.
It's amazing. As I said on the day that
he was assassinated, Charlie Kirk was a
martyr for truth and for freedom
and from Socrates to think and to St.
Peter from Abraham Lincoln to Martin
Luther King those who change history the
most and he really did have always risk
their lives for causes they were put on
earth to defend. He was put on earth to
do exactly what he was doing. He didn't
want to waste time. He would have been a
top student at any college in the
country. I know the college as well. He
was he's smarter than the guy here. He
was so smart.
But he almost I guess didn't have the
time. It was he knew what he wanted to
do. It wasn't like I want to sit in the
classroom for four years listening to
people teach me liberal principles
because they were never going to teach
him that anyway.
But he didn't have the time. He really
didn't have the time. But every time the
enemies of goodness and virtue try to
silence the voice of righteous and noble
leaders like Charlie,
they fail. They seem to fail ultimately.
They look like they're doing well and
then they end up failing because the
truth is been unrelenting over the years
over history.
And people like Charlie, it's just
they've got a power that others don't
have and very few people will ever have.
So today, like those martyrs before him,
Charlie's voice message and his legacy
are stronger and greater
than ever before. They are greater than
ever before. Um, look, this is a
horrible event, but it brought out the
greatness of Charlie. Nothing could have
ever
supplanted this. It's incredible the way
people are talking about him
and uh and with great love. I mean, I
read so many stories about some of the
enemies, but I watch the enemies and
it's hard for them to speak badly about
him because
well, I don't know about that.
And then you do have days since
Charlie's killing. We've seen exactly
why our country
so dearly needed
his example. We've watched legions of
far-left radicals resort to desperate
acts of violence and terror because they
know that their ideas and arguments are
persuading no one. They know that
they're failing. They have
the devil's ideology and they're failing
and they know it. They feel it
and they become violent
because they're seem to become very
violent on the left.
They've rammed vehicles into federal law
enforcement, fired sniper rifles at ICE
agents,
caused so many problems.
But I was made I can't call other people
though.
I made a turn at a good time. I turned
to the right.
Charlie couldn't believe it actually. He
said, "How the hell did you make that
turn?" I said, "I don't know, but uh
fired rifles and threatened the lives of
our Supreme Court justices, our great
justices."
Isn't it crazy that somebody tried to
kill Trump?
We just issued a
We just forget about that.
60 million dollars to protect the
Supreme Court justices.
Very important. We can't let anything
happen
in places of worship where protecting
our people.
We've seen that a candidate for attorney
general in Virginia boasted that he
would want to see the Republican Jones,
a legislator in Virginia shot in the
head and to see his children murdered.
What a dick sucker.
What a dick sucker.
And now he continues to run for office
and most people continue to back him.
What a nasty dick sucker. shot said shot
in the head and to see his children
murdered
and
they keep running. Pretty amazing,
right? That's a bad one.
Yeah,
let's see how that turns out. But that's
a really bad one. Nobody's heard that
one before, especially in the wake of
Charlie's assassination. Our country
must have absolutely no tolerance for
this radical left violence, extremism,
and terror. We're done with the angry
mobs and we're not we're not going to
let
then arrest our cities be safe and make
sure our cities are safe. When you have
Chicago where they had 4,000 people the
mayors
over a very short period of time. 4,000
people
and then we have a governor stand up and
say, "Oh, things are going swimmingly."
No, they're not. We're going to make
Chicago safe just like we're going to
make look what we did in DC. It's so
nice that we started here because this
was one of the most violent places in
the United States.
It'd be dangerous to be right out here,
but you couldn't go to a restaurant. The
restaurants were all dying. The whole
place was dying. You'd have these
gorgees. Look at the Washington Monument
over there. You'd have everything needs
to be a campaign monuments and
structures.
That's where you're wrong.
People were afraid to leave their
apartment. They were afraid to go to
work.
That's where you're wrong.
An Uber and they'd feel safe and then
the Uber would be attacked. They thought
they made it the safety and then the
Uber was attacked on the trip in
but we've done a great job and now it's
considered a totally safe city. We
haven't had problems. Took us 12 days to
make it great. We took out Pam 1,700
hard criminals, career criminals in many
cases, but these are hardened criminals.
Many of them came in through the Biden
open borders. We brought them back to
the countries and a couple were so
violent that we put them in jail. We
don't want to take a chance that they
could get back in cuz no matter how good
we do, somebody can sneak in. We They
were so violent and so so bad. One
arrested 28 times. Every time he left
prison, he'd get into a violent
incident. 28 times and we put him away.
Should have sent him to the moon.
But we're done with the angry mobs.
We're done with it. This is such an
unbelievable
place right now. You take a look where
you can walk down the middle of the
street with your wife or your husband.
Your children can walk. They can walk
alone. It doesn't matter. They can walk
anywhere in Washington now.
If this were a year and a half ago, a
year ago,
they'd have a serious chance of being
badly hurt, even killed.
Even killed. They'd come in from
Indiana. They'd come in from Iowa. They
come from Florida to see their nation's
capital. when somebody would have to
call the parent talking about how safe
it is.
Son or your daughter's been killed.
Oh, that's good.
Not anymore. You hear those sirens going
off? That's good. That's a good sound.
That means they either got the bad guy
or they're going to stop the bad guy.
You didn't hear that sound because
nobody wanted to do anything.
Nobody listen to the beauty of that
sound.
Seriously. And that's the real deal
sirens. They're not politically correct
sirens. You hear them about three miles
away. That's great. What happened? What
the [ __ ] is he talking about?
They're stopping crime. That's what
they're doing.
So, we're done with the voices of fools.
They're fools
and death threats and we're going to
make our cities safe. And I thought it
was Charlie's one of his biggest dreams
was that he couldn't believe it.
It's what he does.
Chicago is going to be a great city
again.
We had people in there six months ago.
And
this governor said, "Well, crime is
down." And yeah, that's cuz we had the
FBI in there for 6 months just preparing
it for the bigger surge and they've done
a great job. The cash and the FBI,
they've done a great job and they love
doing it, you know. They love being able
restricted from doing it. They couldn't
do anything.
Is that really? I don't know.
And uh now they're totally unrestricted.
They all they have to do is stop crime
and they're doing it. By the way,
Memphis, as you know, you heard they
went in about a week ago. one of the
most dangerous places in the country.
Really in the world, it's not just the
country. They have very few cities that
would compare to some of these cities.
You go to Afghanistan, you say, "Oh,
that's unsafe." Well,
the crime numbers are
much better than the crime numbers in
places that we have. So, Memphis, I
understand, is
what
doing unbelievably in one week. It's
like a different place. And this took 12
days. And then after that, we just
perfected it. But after 12 days, we had
good safety here. after one month. It's
like uh it's really amazing. And by the
way, restaurants are booming.
Restaurants are opening up. The big
problem you have, you can't get into a
restaurant in DC anymore.
So, they're opening up. It's a beautiful
thing to see. It's called safety.
It's called law enforcement and letting
them do their job.
Nobody knows what that is. That's why I
said last month that I have directed the
Attorney General and the Department of
Homeland Security to confront the very
real threat of left-wing terrorism in
our country. It's a real threat. Not
when you confront it, it's not because
uh they're not brave people. In fact,
they're cowards. When you confront them,
they immediately fold. You have to see
them fold. You have to see them crying.
I've seen it.
They fold.
I've farmed a lot of clips on this.
dismantling the networks that fund them
and finance them. And we're finding out
who those networks are. We already know
quite a few of them.
When you see these violent incidents and
then you see people holding this
gorgeous sign
with beautiful wood, beautiful
cardboard,
everything's per perfect paint job. And
they're all the same. There are
thousands of them. You know that they
weren't made in the basement out of
love. They were made by anarchists.
Oh.
And in some cases wealthy. I'll probably
find some of my nice friends that are up
there being so nice to me, especially
lately. They're being very nice. But uh
it surprises you who they may be and you
almost wonder why why why would they do
it? But they're hurting our country and
we're really taking it back one by one.
If we didn't go into Los Angeles early
on in the administration, the
commissioner, the chief of police, Los
Angeles said if they didn't go in, we
would have lost our city. Now, they
already lost 25,000 houses to fire
because they wouldn't let the water come
in from the Pacific Northwest.
Remember because the fish
they should have done.
Remember the fish?
You better do it. They didn't do it. And
we had uh 25,000
forgot about the fish.
They had no water in their sprinklers.
They had no water in the fire hydrants.
the smell would have been a different
kind of a thing if they did what they
were supposed to do. We had to break in.
We broke in and had the water come down.
They actually they said for the
environment, great. They lost 25,000
houses. It's uh incredible. But the
commissioner said without the federal
government and
President Trump's intervention, we would
have lost the entire city. Wow.
And we have the Olympics going there
soon. I got the Olympics. We have the
Olympics. We have the World Cup. And we
have, most importantly, we have the
250th anniversary of our country. That's
going to be most important.
And all of these things are happening.
And we're going to have safe cities.
We're going to have very, very safe
cities. So, one month after Charlie,
you got to go after the uh terrible
shock and the pain.
That's what he has to do.
His loss like just about nobody I can
think of. Charlie Kirk was one of a
kind. He was unstoppable. And he really
was. Boy, when he had an idea in his
head, oh, he was he would call me, "Sir,
please. You haven't done it yet." Said,
"Charlie, relax. Just relax."
Yeah, true. I like Charlie even more
now.
Yeah.
Got it done.
I'd have been doing the same.
And always will be. He's really
irreplaceable. Nobody going to replace
them, but they're going to do great, but
you can't replace that kind of person
and that kind of talent. Frankly, the
word talent is an important word, but
that kind of talent. So, we hold his
memory in our hearts forever, every
single day of this administration. We
will continue to carry out
the mission for which he lived. And he
really did. He lived for this country.
He lived for his wife and his family,
but he lived for this country, too.
In Charlie's honor, uh we will continue
like we have been to fight, fight,
fight, and to win win win. We're going
to win so much.
You're going to be tired of winning.
So
you're going to be tired. That's how
much winning
Medal of Freedom is a big deal. You have
the Congressional Medal of Honor,
Military, and the Presidential Medal of
Freedom, which is civilian. And the
Presidential Medal of Freedom is a
really big deal. Very few people get it.
Very few people, frankly, qualify. It's
a decision of the president, but it it's
a qualification that's a very hard one
to to get.
And I would like to ask, if I might, the
military aid to read Charles James
Kirk's citation for the Presidential
Medal of Freedom. Thank you very much.
Oh, here comes the event. Let's get it.
Is he supposed to like say something or
I don't know if this is
The Presidential Medal of Freedom is
awarded to Charles James Kirk. Accepting
on behalf of Charlie is his wife, Mrs.
Erica Kirk. Charlie Kirk was one of the
most influential American political
figures of his generation. At just 18
years old, he founded Turning Point USA
and grew it into the largest
conservative youth organization in the
nation. For over a decade, he tirelessly
traveled the country leading a movement
to restore respect for our founding
principles, reawaken our national
identity, and inspire a renewed spirit
of religious devotion.
He was one of the great debaters and
communicators of his time. Despite
receiving repeated threats, he remained
undeterred and modeled courage, logic,
humor, and grace to the next generation.
On September 10th, 2025, at age 31,
Charlie Kirk was assassinated while
addressing a group of students. The
United States honors him at the Mart for
truth and freedom.
I can't remember why. Yeah, I remember
watching that when it happened.
Holy [ __ ]
There it is.
[Applause]
She's good at why people think that
she's faking it. A lot of people don't
like her for I Why is that? I I don't
really even understand that.
Is there morons? Oh, you know what? That
expl Now I understand.
Yeah.
No, no, it makes a lot of sense.
No, now that now that you think about
like that. Yeah.
Thank you, Mr. President, for honoring
my husband in such a profound and
meaningful way. And thank you for making
this event a priority um with amid the
peace process in the Middle East. Thank
you. very grateful Charlie excuse me

commitment to freedom and that's
something that both of you shared so

will be something I cherish forever so

president and the lovely Usha fans, your
friendship has been an unbelievable
encouragement. Thank you.
Um

all our friends and family that are
here.
Yes, that's why
watching from all around the world.
Of course,
thank you for loving us. Thank you for
praying for us and for believing in what
Charlie believed in.
And to our Turning Point USA staff and
the Charlie Kirk Show staff, we love you
more than you could ever know.
and to the Turning Point USA chapters
that are watching
all across America right now.
You are the heartbeat of this future and
of this movement.
Everything that Charlie built,
you guys are the legacy holders of that.
You are living proof that his mission
did not die with him.
It lives through you.
And Charlie always said, "The next
generation will decide whether freedom
endures."
And because of you, I know that freedom
will endure. It will.
And today, we're gathered not only to
celebrate Charlie's birthday, but to
honor a truth that he gave his entire
life to defend, and that's freedom.
The very existence of the Presidential
Medal of Freedom reminds us that the
national interest of the United States
has always been freedom.
Our founders etched it into the preamble
of our Constitution. And those words are
not relics on parchment.
They are a living covenant.
The blessings of liberty are not man's
invention. They are God's endowment.
Charlie lived for those blessings not as
abstract words but as sacred promises.
He used to love to journal about this
topic
journal
all the time and and with such a heart
postured of gratitude
and he believed that liberty was both a
right and a responsibility.
What's it a lot of people don't freedom
is the ability to do that afterwards
right
I'm just not sure
without fear
and that's how he lived
he was free from fear
he was free from compromise
free from anything that could enslave
his soul
except
his name Charles literally means free
man
and that's exactly who my husband was he
was a free man.
And from the time I met him, sitting
across from him, being interviewed,
yes,
on politics and philosophy and theology,
anything that Charlie loved, any topic
he loved,
and
I just saw the fire in his soul and
there was this
divine restlessness within him that came
from knowing God placed him on this
earth to protect something very, very
sacred
for all of us. And he never stopped
fighting for people to experience
freedom. He didn't.
Charlie often said that without God,
freedom becomes chaos.
Uhoh.
And he believed liberty could only
survive when anchored to truth.
And I remember in one of his speeches
he told the audience that the opposite
of liberty
isn't law.
He said it's captivity
and that the freest people in the world
are those whose hearts belong to Christ.
But what's so powerful is that Charlie
had the ability.
You look healthy today. No, I don't. so
brilliantly across all generations.
And he reminded us that in a world that
tells us freedom is
doing whatever you want to do, the real
freedom
is the power to live freely and to do
what is right.
Well, yeah, that's kind of the
definition.
In one of his journal entries, he wrote
that he wanted everyone to know that you
can't have liberty without moral
responsibility.
Freedom divorced from faith eventually
just destroys itself.
And what's so fascinating about all of
this is looking back these past 12 years
of Turning Point USA and his mission,
there's almost this veil of of
sacredness.
Because what I realized is that while he
was building an organization, he was
also building a movement.
one that called people back to God,
back to truth, and a movement that was
filled with courage.
Yeah.
And ironically, for a man who impacted
millions,
Charlie never desired to be the center
of attention. He just wasn't. My husband
was not a man of extravagance.
He loved simple but deeply meaningful
things. truly he he loved his late night
walks.
He loved buying more books than he could
ever read because he felt there was no
such thing as a a book budget.
And he loved being able to read to our
kids the same bedtime story on repeat
cuz he knew it was their favorite. And
but to him that was special.
and he loved to sit in the sun on a
Saturday morning with his cup of decaf
coffee and his phone was off because he
was honoring the Sabbath. And for him,
it was that moment to catch his breath
and just be in peace
cuz he was unreachable at the moment.
And he preferred quiet birthdays.
But that never stopped me from telling
him. I told him every single year. I
said, "Baby,
I love your birthday." I said, "Because
it's the day that God knew the world
couldn't go another day without you."
And so the rhythm of our usual birthday
celebration for him was
Yeah.
mint ice, mint chocolate chip ice cream.
He only had it twice a year
on his birthday and 4th of July.
And um
that green [ __ ] And then after that it
was back to work as usual. But
last year his one birthday wish was to
see the Oregon Ducks play the Ohio
State.
And they won. Oregon won that night. And
it was by far one of the most memorable
nights of his birthday experience of his
life until today. And so honestly,
President Trump, I have
spent seven and a half years trying to
find the perfect birthday gift for
Charlie.
And it's so difficult. And those of you
that have spouses or loved ones, you
know how difficult it is sometimes to
buy a gift for someone that you love
because he wasn't a materialistic man.
So that also did not help. But now I can
say with confidence, Mr. President, that
you have given him the best birthday
gift he could ever have.
How nice.
It was a nice speech. Bit long, but you
know,
it's such an honor and the recognition
of
a life lived for defending freedom. And
that's what Charlie fought for until his
last breath.
And it was written across his chest in
those final moments on one of his simple
t-shirts that always carried
a message. And this one
Charlie didn't show how dangerous the
world's getting. It showed how many
people secretly wanted it.
That was the banner over his life. And
that shirt was a declaration.
The same declaration he made in every
speech. could have easily known that
every campus visit, every time he shared
the gospel at a church,
every sleepless night that he would
spend praying for the youth of this
nation
and planning for the future of our
country and just oppressing upon them
that when we defend liberty, we defend
the soul of our nation.
My husband never told anyone what to
say. He never did. He never told anyone
what to say. He would just encourage
them to think. He would encourage them
to think outside of the traditional
political labels.
He would want them to think in a way
that was anchored in wisdom and truth.
But he would never tell anyone what to
say.
Charlie wasn't content to simply admire
freedom. He wanted to multiply it. He
wanted to multiply freedom. He wanted
young people to taste it and to
understand it
and defend it. He wanted them to see
that liberty isn't self-indulgence. It's
self-governance.
Well, for me
under God.
Oh,
well,
every day I'd see him getting ready for
work.
He'd put on his cross necklace. He'd put
his ring on his finger.
And the the boldness in his demeanor was
always fearlessness. He wasn't afraid.
He was never afraid.
And his daily actions, whether in office
or on campus or at a church,
it was always without fear. That was his
creed. That is that is how he lived out
every single day. He didn't fear being
slandered. He did not he didn't fear
losing friends. I can tell you that. He
didn't he didn't care. He stood for
truth and stood for freedom. And he did
not everything else was just noise to
him.
And it's because his confidence in
Christ was absolute.
That's why
there was no limit. No limit to what he
would have sacrificed to defend freedom
for all. And if the moment had come, he
probably would have run for president,
but not out of ambition. He would only
have done it if that was something that
he believed.
Yeah. Like me
from a servant's heart standpoint.
And Charlie lived only 31 short years.
thinking about himself
too, but on this side of heaven, but
yeah,
he lived
for sure.
He lived every single second. He lived
filled every single day with purpose and
he fought for truth when it was
unpopular
and he stood for God when it was costly.
But that's what we're called to do.
Surprisingly enough, he did pray for his
enemies, which is very hard, but he did.
Yeah,
he did.
I He did.
Donald was like, "What the [ __ ] Why
would you do that?"
No, he never did it in front of anyone
else, but I can attest to that.
The hell's wrong with him?
He also loved people when it was
inconvenient.
And he ran his race with endurance and
he kept the faith and now he wears the
crown of a righteous martyr.
And for me and for our children,
the the truth really studies our grief
because
heaven gained what earth could no longer
contain.
A free man made fully free.
To all watching, this is this is not a
ceremony.
This is a commissioning.
And my message is simple.
I want you to be the embodiment
of this medal.
I do. I want you to free yourself from
fear.
Yeah.
I want you to stand courageously in the
truth.
Yeah.
Listen for the still small voice of God.
Infested with left hearts. No, that's
not what it is. I'll talk about this
country. Each of us must be intentional
stewards every single day.
God began a mighty work through my
husband and I intend to see it through.
And the torch is in our hands now. It's
in mine. It's in yours. It's in all of
yours. It's in all the students with
Turning Point USA.
Yeah.
And before I close, I'll share with you
that I asked our daughter
what she would like to say to daddy for
his birthday.
Excuse me.
She said
they arrest the guy. Yeah, they got the
guy.
Happy birthday, daddy.
I think it was a furry.
I want to give you a stuffed animal.
I want you to eat a cupcake with ice
cream.
and I want you to go have a birthday
surprise.
I love you is what she said.
And while our son
is precious, he can't yet speak.
In classic Kirk family fashion, his
actions spoke louder than his words. And
his gift to you, Charlie, and myself,
for that matter, was deciding to become
the man of the house and be fully potty
trained at 16 months.
But Charlie, baby, I know that you're
celebrating in heaven today, but gosh, I
miss you. We miss you
and we love you and we promise we'll
we'll make you proud. And
Charlie's life was proof that freedom is
not a testimony.
I have no idea.
He showed us that liberty begins not in
the halls of power, but in the man of a
heart surrendered to God.
And so today, as we honor Charlie with
this
incredible Presidential Medal of Freedom
on his birthday,
I stand here with tears and just humbled
heart and spirit because
his story reminds us all that
to live free is the greatest gift,
but to die free is the greatest victory.
Happy birthday, my Charlie.
Happy freedom day. God bless you.
All right.
So, why do people think that she's like
faking everything for clout? Like, I I
never really understood that. Like,
obviously, she's trying to take
advantage of what she can. She's already
giga-. She doesn't need anything to do
anything like this. She did a speech
like she did a few days after her
husband died asking people to sign up to
tearing print USA. She's in pain. Feel
like most people just disappear. I think
there's a lot of tone policing of like
how people are supposed to act in a
tragedy or in uh you know a stressful
situation. And when people don't act the
way that you would have acted, everybody
thinks that it's inauthentic or
inaccurate or something like that.
I I think trying to police people how to
deal with grief. Yeah, it it's not
really
it's not really that simple. How do you
handle grief?
It is what it is.
My dad a few days before he was going to
die, I told he's like, "Why didn't you
go live?" And I'm like, I was stressed
out about you. He's like, oh Jesus,
what do you mean? It is what it is.
Oh, you missed the stream for this [ __ ]
Yeah.
What a weenie. Yeah. Are you some kind
of a [ __ ]
So, yeah. I I I don't know. Call soft,
boy.
Yeah. So, I I don't think that he uh
Yeah, I I I I don't I don't think that
would really bother him at all.
