You know, I'm a levels trader. If I can
draw a horizontal line on a chart,
that's that's a level. So, support and
resistance, Fibonacci, the previous
day's value,
>> the initial balance, the opening range,
those are all things that I watch very
very closely every single day. The way I
trade today, there's really only two
trades that I ever really focus on, and
that's a previous day's value area play,
and that's the initial balance play.
Those are two trades that I watch every
single day.
>> So, previous day value, I'm assuming
that means a form of the average day of
yesterday, or is it highs and lows of
yesterday? So I take every night I mark
off a chart and I take the previous
day's value and that value is where 70%
of the trading took place and I draw
>> from a volume perspective,
>> right? I draw a block on the chart that
says here's where the previous 70% of
the previous days trading took place.
>> Mhm. When price if price opens outside
of that value area and it moves into
that value area on a fiveminute chart, I
wait until a candle establishes in that
value. And if it establishes in that
value, there's an 80% rule that it's
going to fill value. So if you're coming
down into value,
>> sell it off.
>> It establishes and sells off, there's a
80% chance it's going to fill to the
other side of value. If it comes up into
value, 80% rule is going to fill to the
top.
>> That's one of the trades. So that's an
80% statistic. And Jim Dalton teaches
that and that's very interesting and and
from a market profile perspective it's
very interesting to look at. The other
trade is is the initial balance. The
initial balance is the first hour of
trading.
>> Okay.
>> So when the first hour has happened on
the day I have two lines on the chart. I
have the IB high and the IB low
>> of that initial hour
>> of the initial balance. So that's the
initial balance. When price comes back
up and tests or goes down and tests the
IB low or tests the IB high, there is a
90% stat that says it's going to reject
it.
>> So essentially when you've defined that
range of the first hour and then it
comes back to test it, you just uh sell
it at the open, stop loss at the high
and uh and
>> there's a 90% chance it will reject it
on the on the first test, not second
test, first test.
>> Okay, let's explore both of these. So
the first one is the the 70% of the
volume of the previous day. You mark it
out as a point of interest. So area
first of all
>> it's a value area block. Yeah.
>> That's um let's say previous on average
the average daily range as a proportion
to the range of the 70% of the volume.
Typically what have you found that is a
ratio that the 70% of the volume is
usually a 10% of the ADR or is it
usually a 50? Just to kind of know how
big that zone usually is.
>> The zone varies dramatically. There's
days that zone extremely tight. There's
days on a on a strong trending day. If
we had a lot of volume and it was a
strong trending day, those value areas
can be a 200 point range. Those are days
I love because
>> you prefer the big zone ones cuz there's
more room
>> especially when we open outside of value
on the next day
>> because when we open outside of value on
the next day and we move into value,
that means that the value area play is
in effect. If we open inside of value,
that typically means a chop day.
>> I see.
>> So, I really want to open outside of
value. watch action move back into value
and then take the value area play
>> and and the second model which is kind
of like the range and then tap and go.
Have you found that you can tap and go
and then use the first model as a zone
that the 70% value where it's magnetized
towards so you tap and go into the zone
and then use the closure of the zone as
your final take profit.
>> You can absolutely can. And so on the
value area plays I typically I'll give
myself a little bit more room on those
because I'm more confident in that. I
mean, there's there's a 80% probability
it's going to fill. There's a 90%
probability on the IB trade.
>> And so, what's interesting is I have an
IB indicator that plots it. I use Ninja
Trader as my platform. And I use um uh a
Trade Devil's indicator that plots IB
for me on my Ninja Trader. And there is
it has a stat down in the corner that
tells you how many times that that trade
works over the the
>> the previous weeks. Okay, it's alarming.
We're talking it's 80 90% of the time it
works. Now, it's not it's not that it's
going to be a rejection and it's just
going to trend the opposite.
>> I understand it just be a move and go on
ENQ. If you can pick up a 10point wick,
that's a great trade.
