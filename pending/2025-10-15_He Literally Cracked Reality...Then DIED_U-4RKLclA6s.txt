I would like to confess that I've been
asked to cut about twothirds of my
speech out and deliver as short a speech
as possible. You are free to believe me
or to disbelieve, but please take my
word on it that I am not joking. This is
very serious, a matter of importance.
>> This is the recording some believe cost
him his life. In September 1977, the
writer Philip K. Dick spoke to an
audience in France. They expected
science fiction. What he said instead
revealed too much about reality and drew
the attention of the CIA and FBI,
changing his life forever.
>> The subject of this speech is a topic
which has been discovered recently. A
breaching, a tinkering, a change had
been made, but not in our present, had
been made in our past. a variable was
changed, reprogrammed as it were, and
that because of this, an alternative
world branched off, became actualized
instead of the prior one, and that in
fact, in literal fact, we are once more
living this particular segment of linear
time.
>> He said the CIA and FBI had taken his
work years earlier. That's when, you
know, he may have spoken too much.
>> In March of 74, the CIA opened my mail.
The FBI had a file on me. I've seen
both. Thought the cops were watching
everything I did. And I was correct. And
I was told that the house was being
watched and that eventually my house
would be hit, my files would be opened,
my papers would be taken. And so it came
to pass. When I came home and found my
house consisting of nothing but rubble,
ruins, chaos, broken windows, smashed
door knobs, blown open files. A few
years later, he suddenly dies right
before the premiere of Bladeunner June
1982, the film adaptation of his novel
to Android's Dream of Electric Sheep.
Fans said it was strange that the
author, who had predicted so many modern
themes about AI, identity, and reality,
never got to see the movie that would
finally make him widely famous. What's
strange to me is that he was only
writing science fiction. Yet, the FBI
and CIA started watching him. To me,
that means he was touching information
never meant for the public. That's what
caught my attention. So, listen
carefully to what comes next. I know
attention spans are short, but trust me,
this video will give you chills.
>> We are accustomed to supposing that all
change takes place along the linear time
axis from past to present to future. The
present is an acrruel of the past and is
different from it. The future will acrue
from the present on and be different yet
that an orthogonal or right angle time
axis could exist, a lateral domain in
which change takes place, processes
occurring sideways in reality, so to
speak. This is almost impossible to
imagine. How would we perceive such
lateral changes? What would we
experience? What clues, if we are trying
to test out this bizarre theory, should
we be on the alert for? In other words,
how can change take place outside of
linear time at all in any sense to any
degree? Philip tries to make this
strange idea easier to understand with a
simple picture. Imagine a painting on a
wall. Instead of replacing the whole
painting, the servants secretly change
details on the same canvas. They remove
a tree, add a girl, shift small
elements. When the owner looks at it, he
sees something new yet also familiar.
His brain struggles. It's the same
painting, but also not the same. Dick
uses this example to suggest that
reality might be altered in subtle ways,
not fully replaced.
Contemplating
this possibility of a lateral
arrangement of worlds, a plurality of
overlapping earths along whose linking
axis a person can somehow move, can
travel in a mysterious way from worst to
fair to good to excellent. Contemplating
this in theological terms, perhaps we
could say that herewith we suddenly
decipher the elliptical utterances which
Christ expressed regarding the kingdom
of God, specifically where it is
located. He connects his theory of
parallel worlds to the words of Jesus.
He points out that Jesus gave answers
that seemed contradictory about the
kingdom of God. He said, "My kingdom is
not of this world, but also the kingdom
is within you or among you." Dick
suggests these statements weren't meant
to confuse, but to describe something
deeper. Maybe Jesus was speaking about
these overlapping realms, multiple
realities that can be reached by living
human beings. Some of them dark, others
beautiful, and at the highest level, the
just kingdom of God. I in my stories and
novels often write about counterfeit
worlds, semi-real worlds, as well as
deranged private worlds inhabited often
by just one person. while meantime the
other characters either remain in their
own worlds throughout or are somehow
drawn into one of the peculiar ones.
This theme occurs in the corpus of my 27
years of writing. At no time did I have
a theoretical or conscious explanation
for my preoccupation with these
pluroiform pseudo worlds. But now I
think I understand what I was sensing
was the manifold of partially actualized
realities. It was in February of 1974
that my blocked off memories of track A
returned. And it was in February of 1974
that my novel flow my tears the
policeman said was released finally
after two two years delay.
It was almost as if the release of the
novel which had been delayed so long
meant that in a certain sense it was all
right for me to remember. That is to
remember that the book was not fiction.
The book was based on subliminal
memories which I had of such a world.
>> After connecting his book to subliminal
memories, he went deeper into describing
what happened to him in early 1974. He
said it began after dental surgery when
he was recovering at home. One
afternoon, a delivery girl came to his
door wearing a necklace with a Christian
fish symbol. As the sunlight reflected
off the necklace, Dick saw a sudden
flash of pink light. From that moment
on, he reported a series of overwhelming
visions. He claimed the pink beam
carried information directly into his
mind. Not images he imagined, but
structured knowledge. He suddenly knew
that his infant son had a dangerous
undiagnosed medical condition. When
doctors checked, they confirmed it,
saving the boy's life. To Dick, this
proved the experience was not fantasy.
In the weeks that followed, the visions
intensified. He said he lived in two
overlapping realities. California in
1974 and ancient Rome in the first
century. At times, he believed he was
both himself and a Christian slave
living under Roman rule. He described it
as if time had folded, two tracks of
history running at the same time, and
his consciousness could move between
them. Philip also reported receiving
vast amounts of information, entire
downloads of philosophy, theology, and
science that felt too complex to invent.
He said it was as if an external
intelligence, which he later called Val,
vast active living intelligence system,
was transmitting knowledge into his
brain. For him, this explained why many
of his novels already contained themes
of false realities, hidden powers, and
overlapping worlds. He believed those
stories were subliminal memories
breaking through long before he
consciously understood them.
>> Plural realities did exist, superimposed
onto one another like so many film
transparency. What I still do not grasp,
however, is how one reality out of the
many becomes actualized in
contradistinction to the others. More
likely, the matrix world, the one with
the true core of being, is determined by
the programmer. He or it articulates,
prints out, so to speak, the matrix
choice and fuses it with actual
substance, the core or essence of
reality, that which receives or attains
it, and to what degree that is within
the purview of the programmer. This
selection and reselection is part of
general creativity, of world building,
which seems to be it or his task.
>> As you can see, some people in the
audience laughed at what he was saying.
Remember, this was 1977. Back then,
ideas about multiple realities and
hidden programmers sounded completely
insane to most people. Today, talk of
simulations, parallel worlds, or
alternate timelines isn't new anymore.
Scientists and philosophers discuss it
openly. But what still makes me pause is
not the theory itself. It's the fact
that the CIA and FBI really did open his
mail, keep files on him, raid his home,
and take his papers. That part still
raises questions. If he was just a
sci-fi writer making things up, why go
to such lengths? Maybe he had said too
much. And to make his concept easier to
grasp, he gave an example. He compared
reality itself to a game of chess.
Imagine two players, one representing a
dark destructive force and the other
representing the guiding intelligence
behind reality. On the surface, it can
look like the dark player is winning
moves, capturing pieces, and gaining
control of the board. But in truth, the
game is already structured so that the
ultimate victory belongs to the higher
player. According to this view, the
guiding intelligence, what Dick
sometimes called the programmer, has
already chosen the variables in advance.
Every apparent loss is only part of a
larger sequence that leads to final
victory. People sense this
instinctively, which is why they pray to
be included in that winning path, asking
not to be left behind in the game. To be
left out means staying under the
influence of the destructive force,
stuck in a darker version of reality.
But even as that force seems clever,
even as it appears to win in the short
term, it is already defeated. It is
blind to the full pattern of the game.
The higher player sees the whole board,
sees every possible move, and because of
that, the outcome is decided. The
constructive force will always prevail
and the only question is whether we are
moved along with it or left trapped in
the losing side of the match.
>> I submit to you that such alterations,
the creation or selection of such
so-called alternative presence is
continually taking place. The very fact
that we can conceptually deal with this
notion that is entertain it as an idea
is the first step in discerning such
processes themselves.
>> He gave some very simple examples of how
these shifts might show up in everyday
life. You might reach for a light switch
in your bathroom and suddenly realize it
has always been in a different spot. Or
you might go to adjust the air vent in
your car only to find there was never
one there at all. These are reflexes
left over from another version of the
present. Habits from a timeline that no
longer exists, but which still linger in
your memory at a subconscious level.
Sometimes we even dream of people or
places we've never seen. Yet, they feel
familiar and vivid as if we really had
known them. Most of the time, we dismiss
it and move on. But one of the strongest
impressions many people experience is
deja vu. That strange undeniable feeling
that we are reliving the present moment
exactly as it happened before. We hear
the same words. We say the same words
and we are sure we've been here before.
Dick argued this wasn't just a trick of
the mind. For him, deja vu was evidence.
He believed it was a clue that at some
point in the past a variable had been
changed as if reality was reprogrammed
and that a new timeline branched off
from the old one. In other words, we are
not just imagining it. We are literally
reliving the same segment of time again
only in a slightly altered version of
reality. A breaching, a tinkering, a
change had been made, but not in our
present, had been made in our past.
Evidently, such an alteration would have
a peculiar effect on those persons
involved. They would, so to speak, be
moved back one square or several squares
on the board game, which constitutes our
reality. Conceivably this could happen
any number of times affecting any number
of people as alternative variables were
reprogrammed. We would have to live out
each reprogramming along the subsequent
linear time axis. But to the programmer
whom we call God to him the results of
the programming would be apparent once.
We are within time and he is not. We are
living in a computer programmed reality
and the only clue we have to it is when
some variable is changed and some
alteration in our reality occurs.
>> He believed that every time reality
shifts a new lateral world is generated
and with each shift the guiding
intelligence the programmer achieves a
kind of victory. Each new version of
reality isn't perfect, but it's slightly
better than the one before it. In his
view, the universe is constantly being
refined stage by stage through this
process. The way he described it, the
old universe doesn't disappear. It
becomes raw material, a kind of
stockpile that is used to build the new
one. What looks like chaos or broken
fragments in one timeline might actually
be the foundation for the next. This
means reality isn't moving toward
collapse, but toward improvement. Even
if we can't always see how, the process
keeps pushing forward, generating
alternate worlds, one after another,
each infused with a little more order
and structure than the last. What we
need at this point is to locate to bring
forth as evidence someone who has
managed somehow it doesn't matter how to
retain memories of a different present
latent alternate world impressions
different in some significant way from
this the one which is at this stage
actualized. According to my theoretical
view it would almost certainly be
memories of a worse world than this. For
it is not reasonable that God the
programmer and reprogrammer would
substitute a worse world in terms of
freedom or beauty or love or order or
healthiness by any any standard which we
know.
>> If what Philip K Dick was describing is
true that reality can shift sideways
that alternate versions of the world
appear again and again then maybe we've
already seen signs of it without
realizing. One of the clearest examples
is what we now call the Mandela effect.
Millions of people around the world
share the same memory of something that
doesn't match today's official version
of events. The name itself comes from
people remembering that Nelson Mandela
died in prison during the 1980s. They
remember news reports, public reactions,
even school lessons about his death. Yet
in this timeline, Mandela was released
and later became president of South
Africa, living until 2013. For those who
have the older memory, it feels as
though history was rewritten. And it
doesn't stop there. People remember the
Baronstein Bears spelled as Baronstein
with an E. They remember the Monopoly
man having a monle when in fact he never
did. They recall the movie line, "Luke,
I am your father." When the actual line
is,
>> "No,
I am your father."
>> These aren't just a handful of mistakes.
They're shared, consistent memories
across millions of people, as if we
really had lived in a slightly different
version of reality. Philip K. Dick's
theory offers one possible explanation.
If variables can be changed, if a
programmer can shift us laterally from
one track to another, then deja vu,
false memories, or the Mandela effect
might not be errors at all. They could
be traces of previous presents.
Fragments of timelines we once occupied
but no longer do. This is where things
get even stranger, because it's not just
personal memories. Pop culture itself
sometimes seems to reveal knowledge of
events long before they happen. One of
the most famous examples is The
Simpsons. For more than three decades,
the animated show has been making jokes
that later turn out to mirror realworld
events with uncanny accuracy. Years
before smart watches were invented, The
Simpsons showed characters using wrist
devices to make phone calls. They joked
about a defective autocorrect feature on
a handheld device long before
smartphones made that frustration a
daily reality. They even portrayed
Disney eventually buying 20th Century
Fox, a merger that seemed absurd at the
time, but became reality in 2019. In
another episode, they showed a
skyscraper with a design almost
identical to London's Shard. Drawn over
a decade before construction even began.
They sketched a Nobel Prize prediction
board that matched the actual Nobel
winner announced years later. And in one
story line, they featured a three-eyed
fish living near a power plant, which
was followed years later by news photos
of a three-eyed fish discovered in
Argentina living by water contaminated
from a nuclear facility. At some point,
the list becomes too long to ignore.
These aren't just vague jokes that can
be stretched to fit events. They're
oddly specific details. Many of them
tied to technology, science, or cultural
shifts that hadn't happened yet. Some
people laugh it off as coincidence.
Others wonder if the writers had hidden
knowledge. And some even go further
suggesting half joking but half serious
that the show's creator might have
glimpsed the future or somehow tapped
into the same overlapping layers of
reality Philip K. Dick described back in
1977. When you place these examples next
to his words, the similarities are hard
to miss. He spoke of multiple versions
of the world stacked like film
transparencies with one becoming
actualized over another. Whether through
shared memories, deja vu, or a cartoon
that seems to predict events years ahead
of time, the effect is the same. We're
left questioning whether reality is as
fixed as we assume. And once you notice
it, you start to wonder, are these just
coincidences or are they clues that we
are already slipping sideways, moving
through alternate timelines without even
realizing it?
