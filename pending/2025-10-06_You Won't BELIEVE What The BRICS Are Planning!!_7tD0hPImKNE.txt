Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong-un 
standing together at a military parade sounds like
the opening scene of a Pentagon nightmare. But 
that's exactly what happened recently in Beijing,
complete with nuclear missiles, hypersonic 
weapons, and a guest list that read like
America's sanctions database. And while Washington 
looked on in horror, one of America's top allies
was cozying up to Shei and cutting deals in the 
back of Putin's limo. So what happened? And where
did it all go so wrong for US foreign policy? My 
name is Guy and you're watching the Coin Bureau.
Last month, the United States felt it had to 
teach India a lesson about loyalty. Those rascals
in New Delhi had been buying cheap oil from 
Russia to keep their energy prices manageable,
knowing full well that this undermines the West 
sanctions regime and America's appearance of
being in charge. The sentence handed down from the 
White House was a 50% tariff on Indian exports,
framed by the State Department as a defense of the 
rules-based order. "India needs to stop funding
Russia's war machine," they said, hoping that 
nobody would notice how American nuclear plants
keep running on Russian uranium and European 
factories depend on Russian palladium. Now,
India's commerce minister called it economic 
blackmail. The State Department called it
principal diplomacy. And well, you can make your 
own mind up about that. And that 50% tariff was
actually two separate 25% tariffs, both meant 
to put India back in its place. The Russian
oil tariff was overlaid on top of an existing 
25% reciprocal tariff to punish India for its
average effective tariff rate on American goods of 
7.5%. Don't ask me, I'm not a maths guy. The 50%
now applies to everything from Indian textiles 
to pharmaceuticals shipped to the US affecting
around 15 billion dollars in annual trade. Most 
of which is probably now priced out of the market.
But while India was getting hammered, America 
was feeling more merciful towards China. On the
12th of August, Washington and Beijing agreed to 
another 90 days of relief from the pending 145%
tariff rate. It's been a messy year of threats, 
roll backs, and postponements, so don't feel
too bad if you haven't managed to keep up. After a 
bonkers tit for tat left each country on the sharp
end of a tripledigit tariff threat in April, 
the US and China agreed in May to a temporary
reduction. For 90 days, they enforced lower rates 
of 30% and 10% respectively and resumed issuing
statements about quote productive negotiations 
and quote mutual understanding. In August,
this arrangement was extended for a second 
time and will now be in place until around
the 10th of November. So yes, India, which 
hosts American military exercises and spent
$20 billion buying American weapons last year, 
was rewarded with a devastating punishment,
while China, which does no such thing, got the 
carrot. Make of that what you will. Anyway,
by late August, India's economic affairs secretary 
was busy announcing support packages for affected
exporters while the government ramped up its 
trade negotiations with fellow BRICS nations,
Asian countries, and the Gulf states. Having 
tasted the same stick that the US normally
uses to discipline your Iran's, Venezuelas, and 
North Koreas, India said, "I deserve better and
began exploring rupee to rubble and rupee to yuan 
payment mechanisms to bypass the dollar entirely."

So on the 31st of August, India's Prime Minister 
Narendra Modi went off to Tianin for the summit
of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization or SEO, 
the security club that includes China, Russia,
Iran, and other non-western aligned states. The 
timing was impeccable. While American diplomats
were still explaining why punishing India was 
actually good for democracy, Modi was patching
things up with Xi Jinping. Now, for context, 
India and China were at each other's throats
over a messy border dispute for over a decade. 
If your algorithm ever fed you viral videos of
skirmishes between Indian and Chinese forces armed 
with sticks and stones, yep, that's what they were
beefing over. You have to hand it to them. It's 
much harder to accidentally start World War II
with a bunch of sticks, right? Well, anyway, this 
military standoff was quietly resolved last year,
conveniently clearing the path for exactly this 
moment. She pulled out all the stops. Quote,
"The dragon and elephant have to unite," he told 
Modi, dropping the kind of line that makes State
Department wons reach for the antacids. "Both 
leaders made sure everyone heard them declare
they were quote development partners and not 
rivals." And if the subtext wasn't clear enough,
Modi then broke the fourth wall, stared right at 
the camera lens, and declared that India China
relations quote should not be seen through a third 
country lens. Translation: Stop trying to use us
against each other. We'll figure this out for 
ourselves. And that one's got to sting. American
strategists spent a decade positioning India as a 
free market counterweight to China in a strategy
that lasted about 72 hours after the tariffs hit. 
And the very next day, Modi met with Putin. Now,
if the she meeting was awkward for Washington, 
this one was just painful. Quote, "India and
Russia have always stood shoulderto-shoulder, even 
in the most difficult situations," Modi announced,
while presumably still buying that verboten 
Russian oil. "Pin beamed, the cameras rolled,
and someone in Langley was probably throwing 
their slippers at the TV screen." Meanwhile,
the SEO itself was having a moment. The 
organization rolled out its vision of
indivisible security. The idea that one nation's 
security can't come at the expense of anothers.
Sounds nice, but it's pure poison to the Atlantic 
alliance of NATO, whose existence is premised on
the very divisible security of West versus 
the rest. The SEO wants no military blocks,
no zero sum games, just everyone getting along in 
a multi-olar world. Now whether you buy it or not,
the message was clear. There's an alternative 
to the western security architecture and it's
accepting applications. Now by the 2nd of 
September, Modi was heading home having
essentially flipped Washington the bird using only 
diplomatic language and photo ops. But little did
they know that the real show was about to begin. 
On the 3rd of September, Xi Jinping stood at the
center of Tanaman Square with Vladimir Putin on 
his right and Kim Jong-un on his left. The three
of them cackled like old friends while nuclear 
missiles, robot dogs, and a whole load of other
scaryl looking weapons rolled past. Now, if you'd 
pitched this hammy scene to a Hollywood studio
5 years ago, they'd have probably shown you the 
door. But in total, 25 heads of state showed up to
China's V-Day military parade, including Iran's 
President Peskian, Myanmar's military chief,
and leaders from Pakistan, Vietnam, and most of 
Central Asia. Slovakia's Robert Fico and Serbia's
Alexander Vuch carried the team for Europe. The 
contrast with China's military parade back in
2015, attended by South Korea's president and the 
US ambassador, was stark. But symbolism aside,
the hardware China had on display is also worth 
your attention. For the first time in history,
they showed off their complete nuclear triad with 
land, sea, and air weapon systems, all capable of
launching nukes. And the parade announcers weren't 
subtle about it either, calling it quote, "China's
strategic trump card for safeguarding national 
sovereignty and defending national dignity."
I don't know how that sounded in Chinese, but 
the English translation is a bit on the nose,
isn't it? Anyway, guests retreated to a look 
at new ICBMs with a 20,000 km range capable of
hitting Washington from anywhere in China, 
a massive black underwater drone that look
like something out of a Bond film, and hypersonic 
missiles specifically designed to sink aircraft
carriers, which the Chinese media helpfully 
calls carrier killers, in case anyone missed
the point. We imagine that somewhere deep in the 
Pentagon, a team of accountants is pouring over
zoomed-in parade footage trying to calculate the 
new price of military intervention in Taiwan. Now,
conspicuously absent from Beijing's parade was 
Narendra Modi. After spending 2 days cheesing
with Xi and Putin in Chanzhin, he skipped the main 
event entirely. Was he trying to avoid overdoing
rage baiting Washington? Well, maybe. But the US 
doesn't appear to be the main reason. Modi skipped
the parade. Apparently, the real reason was Japan. 
Anonymous Indian government sources told the Japan
Times that India regards the parade as an event 
marking China's victory over Japan, which is
perfectly accurate, and that quote, "India has no 
intention of hurting Tokyo." Now, that last part
is a remarkable angle given that the victory in 
question was China's liberation from colonial rule
and plunder by the Nazi allied Japanese Empire in 
World War II. But well, you can't be too careful,
I suppose. For reference, Japan had just pledged 
to invest 10 trillion yen or about 67 billion in
India in late August. And this might have spoiled 
Mod's appetite for spectating at China's V-Day
parade. He needs Japanese investment almost as 
much as he needs Russian oil. So Modi attended
the summit, cut his deals, then conveniently had 
urgent business back in New Delhi before the tanks
started rolling. Now this is multi-alignment 
done beautifully. Deepen ties with China and
Russia while keeping Japan happy. Buy Russian oil 
while maintaining American military contracts.
Join BRICS initiatives while staying in the Quad, 
India's security partnership with the US, Japan,
and Australia. It's the geopolitical equivalent of 
dating multiple people who all hate each other and
somehow making it work. By Wednesday morning, the 
pictures were all over the internet. Washington's
Indo-Pacific strategy was in a shambles and all 
it took was a bad tariff and a good parade. Now,
while the West was doomscrolling parade 
clips, Putin and she were busy cutting
some rather important deals themselves. The power 
of Siberia 2 pipeline deal stuck in negotiations
for years suddenly got unstuck. Putin called it 
the culmination of patient work driven by China's
growing economy and its need for reliable energy, 
which is a nice way of saying Russia desperately
needs customers and China wants cheap pipeline 
gas priced in yuan. That pipeline will pump 50
billion cubic meters of Russian gas to China 
every year through Mongolia. For context,
that's about what Germany used to buy from 
Russia before the Nordstream 2 pipeline was
blown up. This time though, the gas pipe to 
China will be priced in rubles and yuan only,
not a dollar in sight. Meanwhile, in Mumbai, 
the Reserve Bank of India was doing its own
dollar dodging. Within weeks of the tariff shock, 
they started setting up rupee to ruble payment
mechanisms for oil trades. The same system 
they'd been exploring for years was suddenly
operational. Funny how tariffs can speed things 
up. In about six weeks, Trump's tariffs did more
for ddollarization than bricks had accomplished in 
years of summit declarations. Before the tariffs,
40% of Indian farmer exports went to the United 
States, accounting for around $6 billion in
annual trade. By September, those same companies 
were redirecting shipments to Brazil, Russia,
and Southeast Asia, with payment increasingly 
handled through new rupeebased mechanisms.
Trade wars tend to work best when your target has 
nowhere else to go. And 20 years ago, that might
have been true. But at this point, the market 
infrastructure for circumventing western markets
has been established for some time. It just needed 
activation. BRICS countries now represent 37% of
global GDP when measured by purchasing power par. 
The SEO covers 40% of the world's population.
These countries are economic giants now. When 
India needs new markets, China's middle class
is right there. When Russia needs customers, 
Asia's energy demand is insatiable. Now,
the West still dominates the financial plumbing 
with Swift dollar clearing, correspondent banking,
and so on. But that monopoly only really works if 
everyone needs to use it. The moment major powers
start launching workarounds, the game is up. China 
knows this and that's why their central bank's
crossber interbank payment system recently went 
live with real dollarless transactions flowing
between Moscow, New Delhi and Thran. So don't be 
surprised if you hear about more countries using
this system every time someone gets tariffed to 
death by Washington. And it's remarkable how much
times have changed. Once upon a time, American 
economic coercion was strong enough to break the
back of an empire. In 1956, Britain teamed up with 
Israel and France to invade Egypt after President
Nasa dared to nationalize Egypt's sewers canal. US 
President Dwight Eisenhower was incensed because
he feared that this would alienate Western aligned 
Middle East countries and push them closer to the
Soviet Union. The invasion triggered a massive 
loss of international confidence in the financial
stability of Britain, which was already up to 
its eyeballs in post-war debt and running current
account deficits. Faced with a run on the pound, 
the Bank of England was tasked with defending the
currency on a shoestring budget. And that didn't 
go so well. What Britain really needed was an
emergency loan. the kind of loan that is normally 
dished out by the IMF. For the US, which wanted
Britain out of Egypt, getting its way was like 
taking candy from a baby. Eisenhower threatened
to dump British bonds, a move that would turn a 
currency crisis into total collapse. And not only
that, the US also blocked the UK from receiving 
emergency loans from the IMF. Checkmate. So,
it wasn't long before Britain came scurrying 
out of Egypt with its tail between its legs,
all but confirming the end of British imperial 
power. And the lesson from this experience stuck
for 70 years. If you defy the Yankee Leviathan, 
you lose access to money. It worked on Britain
and God knows how many other countries since. But 
this time with India, it just flopped. They got
the tariff treatment and flew straight to Beijing 
to break bread with shei and Putin. In America's
heyday, if Washington cut you off from dollars, 
your goose was cooked. No IMF meant no emergency
loans. No World Bank meant no development finance. 
But in 2025, India's got options. China's new
development bank has $50 billion in capital 
ready to be deployed. loans which come with
no American veto and no requirements to privatize 
your water supply. When Britain needed emergency
funds in the 1950s, they had one phone number to 
call. When India needs them today, they've got
a whole contact list. So, we've seen the preview. 
India ate a 50% tariff and responded by deepening
ties with America's rivals. The question now is 
what happens if the pending 145% tariff on China
actually comes into effect. That's an economy four 
times larger than India's with far more leverage
and deeper trade integration globally. So all 
eyes are now on the 10th of November when we'll
either see Trump kicking the can down the road 
again, which just about everyone is hoping for,
or pressing the red button and finding out what 
it does. If those 145% tariffs hit, it is a
death sentence for China's $500 billion in annual 
trade with the US. That's electronics, machinery,
consumer goods, basically everything on Walmart 
shelves. Washington seems to think China needs
American consumers more than America needs Chinese 
factories. Maybe that was true in 2010, but China
has been building its domestic market for over 
a decade now. Their middle class is 400 million
strong and growing. China's total exports were 
$3.6 trillion last year. So losing $500 billion
of that would not likely be fatal. On the other 
hand, the economy is wrangling with deflationary
pressures with weak consumption and slowing 
growth. It's not like the internal market can
replace American demand. So all the better to have 
a plan B that includes trade deals. across Asia,
Africa, and Latin America then, not to mention 
the growing BRICS clique. And they just welcomed
Indonesia as member number 10. So that's Southeast 
Asia's biggest economy officially picking a side.
Malaysia, Thailand, and Nigeria signed on 
as partners. Heck, even Turkey wanted in,
and they're supposed to be a part of NATO. Now, 
we may see this trade machinery become much more
active in the coming years as global alliances 
reshuffle. However, it'll be much harder for Trump
to tariff China up the wazoo than it was for India 
because his China tariffs are a gun that can't
actually be fired without America blowing its own 
foot off. And the US oligarchy likely won't allow
that to happen because Tim Cook and Elon Musk 
have better lobbyists than the State Department
has China hawks. Still, watch this space though 
because we're not even a quarter of the way
through the second Trump administration. And 
who knows what he might do next that could send
US allies googling how to join bricks. You know, 
like invading Venezuela or annexing Greenland or
something. And if you'd forgotten all about that, 
then check out this video to see why on earth he
wants to acquire a 51st state in the middle of the 
Atlantic. But that's all from me for now. If you
want to learn more about the bricks, then check

And as always, thank you for watching and I'll 
see you next time. This is Guy. Over and out.
