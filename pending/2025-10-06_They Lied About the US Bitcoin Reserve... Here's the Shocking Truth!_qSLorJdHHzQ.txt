Has the US government's plan for a strategic 
Bitcoin reserve just collapsed? A recent
Freedom of Information request has 
revealed a shocking lack of progress,
sending a wave of confusion through the market. 
Some are calling it a bureaucratic failure.
Others believe it's a sign the entire project was 
dead on arrival. But what if I told you the real
story is far more complex and that the biggest 
revelation isn't what the government hasn't done,
but what it doesn't have. The government. The 
government. My name is Nick and you're watching
the Coin Bureau. First up though, I am not a 
financial adviser and nothing in this video
should be considered financial advice. This is 
educational content meant to inform you about the
latest developments surrounding the US strategic 
Bitcoin reserve and their potential impact. If
that sounds good to you, hit those like and

to understand where we're going, you first have to 
understand the entire SB saga from its hype filled
announcement to this recent letdown. It all began 
in July 2024. At the Bitcoin 2024 conference,
Donald Trump announced his intention to establish 
a national Bitcoin reserve if elected. Just days
later, Senator Cynthia Lamus introduced the 
Bitcoin Act, a groundbreaking bill proposing the
purchase of 1 million BTC for this new reserve. 
The vision was for the United States to hold
approximately 5% of the total Bitcoin supply and 
mirroring the scale of it strategic gold reserves.
Fast forward to March 2025 and President Trump 
made good on his promise, signing an executive
order to establish the strategic Bitcoin reserve. 
The market initially surged with BTC jumping from
nearly $85,000 to over $94,000 in a matter 
of hours. But then came the details and the
disappointment. The reserve would only be funded 
by BTC the government had already seized through
criminal and civil forfeite cases. There were no 
plans for the US government to actively buy more
of it and the market reversed sharply. In fact, 
the volatility created the largest CME futures
gap in history, a staggering $10,350. The message 
was clear. The market had hoped for a massive new
buyer and instead it got an accounting change. And 
this brings us to the recent bombshell disclosure.
And the March executive order required all federal 
agencies to report on their authority to transfer
seized assets to the new stockpile. Those reports 
were due to the Treasury on April 5th, 2025. But a
Freedom of Information request revealed that 
6 months later, the Treasury still doesn't
have them. In response, the Treasury directed 
inquiries to the individual agencies like the IRS
and the Secret Service. And this isn't a policy 
reversal. It's a bureaucratic inertia, a sign that
the administration is struggling with the simple 
task of getting its own house in order. But here's
the real kicker. The story gets even stranger. A 
separate FOIA request to the US Marshall Service,
the agency responsible for handling seized assets, 
revealed that they hold just 28,988 Bitcoin,
worth around $3.3 billion. The number is a 
shocking 86% lower than the widely cited figure of
over 200,000 BTC which blockchain analytics firm 
Arkham Intelligence tracks across all government
wallets. And this discrepancy has created massive 
confusion. Has the government quietly sold off
the majority of its Bitcoin? Or are the assets 
simply spread across various agencies that are
failing to report back to the Treasury? The lack 
of clarity has been toxic for market sentiment,
a fact made worse by confusing statements from 
Treasury Secretary Scott Pessant himself. In a
television interview, he stated that the US 
would not be buying Bitcoin for its reserve,
which triggered an immediate market selloff, 
sending Bitcoin from $121,000 down to $118,000 in
under an hour. He later walks back those comments 
on X, clarifying that the Treasury is exploring
quote budgetneutral pathways to acquire more 
Bitcoin. It's a textbook case of mixed messaging
creating uncertainty. And if you want to make the 
most of that uncertainty and volatility, then you
need an exchange to do it. How does a $20,000 in

is the dream of the fully funded strategic Bitcoin 
reserve still alive? Well, I mean that depends on
Congress. Senator Cynthia Lemus' Bitcoin Act 
of 2025 goes far beyond the executive order.
It would enshrine the reserve into law, making 
it permanent. And more importantly, it would
mandate the purchase of 200,000 Bitcoin per year 
for 5 years. Now, to put that into perspective,
post Haring, only about 164,000 new Bitcoin are 
mined every year. This bill would force the US
government to absorb more than the entire supply, 
creating a monumental supply shock. But what are
the chances of this passing? Well, the political 
landscape is favorable. Pro-Crypto Republicans
now chair the key banking committees in both the 
House and the Senate, and the crypto industry's
lobbying arm, Fair Shake Pack, has raised over 
$116 million for the 2026 elections. However,
the statistical reality is brutal. According to 
govrak us, the bill has just a 1% chance of being
enacted. It faces a wall of Democratic opposition 
from figures like Maxine Waters and Elizabeth
Warren. And as of now, it has zero bipartisan 
support. And this brings us to the bigger
narrative battle playing out among the experts. 
On the one side, you have the bulls like Michael
Sailor. He's actively lobbying for the bill in 
Washington, arguing a fully funded SPR would
create up to $81 trillion for the Treasury, 
enough to offset the entire national debt.
Kathy Wood of Arc Invest also sees it as a major 
catalyst, helping to drive her firm's bullcase of
$3.8 million per Bitcoin by 2030. But on the other 
side, the skepticism is profound. In a February
2025 survey by the University of Chicago, not a 
single economist agreed that creating a strategic
crypto reserve would benefit the US economy. 
Critics argue that it's a solution in search of a
problem, a political maneuver that contradicts the 
very ethos of a decentralized asset. Which brings
us to the most important philosophical question. 
Does Bitcoin even need a government reserve? For
Bitcoin purists, the answer is a resounding no. 
They argue that government accumulation is a
vector of centralization, a Trojan horse that 
threatens Bitcoin's core value proposition of
operating outside of the traditional system. 
Salana co-founder Anatoli Yakavo summed it
up perfectly when he said, quote, "If you want 
decentralization to fail, you'd put the government
in charge of it." And here's the thing, he 
might be right. The Bitcoin's fundamentals
are strengthening completely independent of 
government action. The spot Bitcoin ETFs have
been a monumental success, attracting over $55 
billion in cumulative net inflows. Meanwhile,
onchain, the picture is even more bullish. A 
staggering 74% of all Bitcoin is now considered
illquid, meaning it hasn't moved in over 155 days. 
And this is long-term holders refusing to sell,
creating an intense supply squeeze. This isn't 
government policy. This is a structural shift
in how the world's largest pools of private 
capital view this asset class. So what could
all of this mean for the price of Bitcoin going 
forward? Well, we're now facing two very distinct
potential futures. In the first scenario, the 
administrative hurdles are cleared and Congress
against the odds passes a version of the Bitcoin 
Act. The resulting supply shock from government
buying would be unprecedented in this environment. 
forecasts from analysts at Bernstein calling for a
$200,000 Bitcoin by the end of 2025 seem not 
just possible but perhaps even conservative.
In the second scenario, the SPR remains a paper 
reserve funded only by existing seized assets.
Uh the narrative catalyst is gone. In this world, 
Bitcoin's fate rests entirely on the shoulders of
ETF inflows and the corporate treasury demand. 
While still bullish long-term, it leaves the
market vulnerable to corrections. Analysts have 
identified the $70,000 to $75,000 range as a
critical support zone in a worst case scenario 
where macroeconomic headwinds pick up. Right now,
the market is caught in the middle with the price 
consolidating between $110,000 and $117,000,
waiting for the next major signal. So to recap, 
the ambitious plan for the US strategic Bitcoin
reserve began with a grand promise, but has since 
slammed into a wall of bureaucratic delay, market
disappointment, and political gridlock. The recent 
FOIA disclosures revealed not a deliberate policy
failure, but administrative chaos and a major 
discrepancy in what we thought the government
actually holds. While legislation to mandate 
Bitcoin purchases remains a steep uphill battle,
the expert community remains deeply divided on 
whether it's a necessary catalyst or a dangerous
distraction. The ultimate bullcase for Bitcoin, 
however, may not even need it. The path of least
resistance still appears to be higher thanks 
to powerful onchain fundamentals and relentless
institutional adoption that is happening with or 
without Washington's help. The SPR narrative has
shifted from guaranteed rocket fuel to a political 
wild card. The key now is recognizing that this
recent disappointment, while painful, may simply 
be clearing the way for a more sustainable private
sectorled rally. And do we really want governments 
interfering anyway? Of course not. Of course not.
