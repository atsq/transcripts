Okay, J. One of the most common research
terms out there, mate, is all about how
to come from the inside. A lot of
players trying to rectify their slice
and they're trying to get the golf club
returning from it into out path to get
that ball curving from right to left for
the right-hander mate. So, a lot of
this, however, can be simply done
through an awareness of your pressure.
So when people go into their back swing
here, when they go into this early
transition stage and we were just kind
of working with a little gizmo that we
put on you, what do we see a lot with
guys that kind of comes over the top is
this super narrowing of this trail arm.
>> Big time. Big time. really comes into
actually get them to feel like they're
actually going to be kind of pushing
along that shaft,
>> feeling like that trail arm actually
extend a little bit in transition.
>> Mhm.
>> To actually kind of really shallow out
the club.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
>> Right. Kind of laying the club down a
little bit. Where if guys kind of leave
it up, maybe get more narrow, they're
probably gonna feel pretty steep. Right.
Now, what we're talking about with this
lead foot, however, is actually as guys
kind of almost struggle to rotate their
hips into the shot, right? As you come
down,
>> okay, what you're going to see is Krod
is actually not only pushing with his
trail foot in this direction early in
the down swing. Right
>> now, he's actually pushing towards the
golf ball
>> and away from the golf ball. Yeah,
>> cuz that ground reaction force is going
to be working on the opposite direction.
So, I actually really love this feeling
of actually guys that when they're
struggling
to open up this hip,
>> do this for me here, K Rob, where you're
actually just going to go right here.
Club kind of on the ground like this.
>> Okay.
>> And give me this little soccer kick this
way.
>> Okay.
>> So, almost this feeling where he's
actually going to be driving his foot
>> towards the ball, opening up that hip.
>> Yeah. So definitely what I'm feeling
here when I do this exercise guy is the
more that I push into the ground in that
piece starting that down swing there the
ground is pushing back not with two
hands itself and it's encouraging my
lead hip to move back out and away which
then facilitates that rotation. Too many
players are out there simply getting to
the top and trying to drive all their
weight back to their heel and that's
what keeps them back through the ball
causes hanging back and all sorts of
issues. Yeah, we definitely want to be
careful cuz we've also seen that if guys
actually put their pressure way too far
on the toes. Yeah, we starting to get
this kind of very saggy knee look. Yeah,
>> of course. Right. But it's almost if
anything, it's almost like you're almost
driving your foot towards the ball
>> and away from the target so that you can
almost kind of open up your hips during
the swing. Yeah, we do see a lot of
drills done by long drive athletes that
are doing a very similar thing where
they will get their body into a position
where they're trying to push as hard as
they can and then clear it out of the
way. As players do do this jar and let's
say that I'm at the top of my swing just
to build awareness for them. Swing it to
the top here. Pressure down. At what
stage does it start moving back towards
the heel here?
>> I would say probably later in P6, right?
But
>> it can be it can be much earlier than
that for different players too, right?
But that's even hard for for most
players to even think about.
>> What I actually get people to do is is
actually just this simple concept of
like, okay, if you're going to walk
backwards
>> Yeah.
>> Right. you're actually pushing this foot
>> Yeah.
>> back this way. So, I actually get a lot
of success with people actually doing a
little simple drill like this
>> where they're actually gonna kind of
stand in this crisscross pattern like
this. They're almost going to make a
practice swing and is as they're coming
down, they're actually going to be
pushing and almost hopping over that
fence there.
>> Yeah. And I'm going to do a slow motion
video of Kyle Burks here uh hitting a
shot. We're just watching some over
there as we're having some lunch. And
you can see that as he's coming down in
transition, his big foot is just like
powering off and extending. And that's
where you'll see these guys explode into
the golf ball. And then that uh front
foot kind of shift back and behind them
there. So really when it comes to the
importance of how you're shifting away,
we don't want to just stay over the
ball, not shifting our pressure and
staying unathletic throughout the whole
motion, do we mate? We want to be very
attuned to the fact that we are playing
an athletic game here. We do want to
create certain amounts of pressure to
allow our body to open up and extend.
Thanks for watching this video. YouTube
thinks that you would benefit from
watching this one next. So, click that
card and it could be the tip that you
need to take your game to the next
level. I'll see you next time.
