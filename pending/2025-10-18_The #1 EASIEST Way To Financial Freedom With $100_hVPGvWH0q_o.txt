what are the returns that I'm likely to
get from investing in the S&P 500. I
really want to simplify this for people
that are at the very start of their
investing journey, you know, because I
mean this is what you spend so much of
your time doing that I just think about
my my team here at the D of a CEO.
There's about 30 people and we started
talking about money one day and it was
mindblowing how nobody in my team's
lives had ever had the conversation with
them about investing. We all think of
investing as something that rich people
after the age of 40 do once you have a
million dollars.
>> Um or if you don't have a million
dollars, then the only other way to
invest we're taught is to buy a house.
Ah,
>> this is driving me insane.
>> It's true though, isn't it?
>> Yes. And that's that's the central part
of my work is that you can live a rich
life and that rich life can be richer
and more vibrant and more personal than
you ever imagined. If you want to
travel, you can travel for longer than
you ever thought. You can travel, for
me, at nicer hotels. You can uh spend
more time with your children, with your
loved ones. Whatever your rich life is,
you can do that. But you've got to learn
a few key basic things about investing
and money. So, let me tell you what I
would tell my family when they come to
me. They go, "How should I start
investing?"
The simplest simplest way that I advise
my family is I say get a target date
fund. So let me explain what that is. A
target date fund is one fund just one
and you pick it based on the year that
you're going to retire. So if you're
going to retire in 2050,
if you're going to be 65 in 2050, you go
and you find that one fund. It's called
a Vanguard 2065 fund or Fidelity 2065 or
Schwab 2065. There's lots of brokers.
These funds, it's one fund. All you do
is put money into it. That's it. The
fund like a pie chart is automatically
diversified. So, as you get older, it
gets more conservative because somebody
who's 75 years old should be investing
differently than someone who's 25.
One fund. All you have to do is set your
money up to go into it every single
month.
>> What is a fund?
>> A fund is uh a set or a basket of stocks
and maybe bonds. So, we've all heard of,
you know, companies like Microsoft,
Google, whatever. A fund owns lots of
these, right? And that's important
because we've heard diversification,
like you should have diversified your
investments. Okay? Well, how do I do
that? You don't need to go and buy 20
stocks and then figure out how much of
each to do. That's too much work. And
honestly, most people are not good at
that, even professionals. You buy a fund
which automatically owns lots of stocks,
like hundreds of them. And over time,
all you, the individual investor like
me, have to focus on is putting money
into it automatically.
>> So, a fund essentially, I've got a
hundred pounds that I want to invest.
Um, I find a fund. Where do I find these
funds?
>> You can go to Vanguard, Schwab, or
Fidelity. All those are great companies.
Uh what you're looking for, regardless
of what country you're in, is you're
looking for a lowcost brokerage firm.
>> So, but there's also apps and stuff that
I can I can
>> You can use apps. I don't like a lot of
the apps because they gify you to try to
invest.
>> They want you clicking and trading. I
hate traders. Trader, you do not want to
be a trader. Traders lose money.
Investors treat investing like watching
paint dry.
>> That's how sexy it is. Trust me, I'm not
getting my entertainment from investing.
I'm going out. Go watch a movie. Go
watch Netflix.
But investing is boring and automatic.
That's how it should be. I used a a a
company called Hargrieve Lands down in
the UK who have an app. When I first
started investing, um when I first
started investing in funds, they they
had a very ugly app, so I wasn't very
compelled to use I think it's better
now, but I would use just do it on
desktop, which I do get your point
because you don't want to you don't want
to be game. You don't want to screen all
of that. Not
>> I like ugly. It should be ugly
>> and you don't want it to be too
accessible as I don't want to be able to
check it every day.
>> No, look on my phone, you will see no
investing apps.
>> There should not be. Why do you need to
log in and check it every day? What's
the point? In fact, I log, you know,
most people should check it
>> every 3 to 6 months. And here's how you
check it. You log in on your desktop.
Wow, it's up. Wow, it's down. Okay, bye.
You're not tweaking anything. It's like
making Thanksgiving dinner. Once you've
put the turkey in the oven, just let it
sit. Do not fiddle with it because
you're only going to mess it up. And in
this case, you're letting the turkey
cook for decades.
>> And that fund. So, I've got a £100. I go
on a website.
>> Yep. Vanguard, Fidelity Schwab, whatever
they are. I have no alliance to any of
them.
>> Neither do I. Um there's various ones in
the UK. I actually do recommend Harg
Group Lands down just because it's quite
simple and I think investing in funds
there's no fees there's no fee
associated with the investment itself.
Obviously they take a you know that
might take a percentage depending on
which fund you're investing in. Mhm.
>> I take my 100
>> and investing in Hargrave Landown, you
don't need there's no um minimum.
>> Great.
>> From what I understand and there's no,
if you invest in a stock, they charge 12
pounds per investment, but if you invest
in a fund, it's free. Um I put my£100
into a fund. The fund is essentially
taking one pound, one of those pounds
and investing£1 into Facebook. It's
investing one pound into Google, one
pound into Shopify, one pound into
Spotify, one pound into Nvidia or
whatever. It's doing that for me. It's
managing it for me. It's making the
decisions for me. I just put the money
in every month, whatever I can, and I
leave it.
>> Yeah. And let's go even deeper. I love
that we're getting into the nuts and
bolts here because, you know, honestly,
most people, they do not know how to
invest. Literally, what website do I go
to and then what do I do?
The fund owns these different stocks and
some will go up and some will go down
and it's inconsequential to you. All you
need to know is you own this fund.
Now that you've opened up an account and
you've sent a hundred bucks or a
thousand bucks, great. You've made one
of the most important decisions of your
life. Now, there's just one more thing
you have to do. Set up an automatic
transfer so that every single month you
have a certain amount of money going in.
Now, if you don't know how much money,
use my conscious spending plan
guideline. What would I say? 5 to 10% of
take-home is a good guideline. All
right, you should be able to do 5%.
Trust me. Anyone who comes to me, they
go, "Reit, there's no way. Must be nice.
I can't afford." I go, "Show me where
you're spending your money. I guarantee
you I can find 5% to send in every
month." Now, you're not trying to send
it in. I don't try to brush my teeth in
the morning. It's a habit. Investing is
even easier than brushing your teeth
because you set it up automatically. the
investment fund will automatically draw
from your checking account and it will
pull in a hundred bucks, 500 bucks, a
thousand bucks, whatever your number is.
And so you're not going to log in for
three, four, five months. You're going
to log in a few months later. You're
going to be like, "Oh my god, I didn't
even realize that all this money is in
here." When you add that plus
compounding over many years, that is how
real wealth is created. So, I don't want
anyone to think that you have to be rich
in order to start investing. One of the
ways you get rich is by investing. I've
got a friend that's currently actually
in this building at the moment, and I
had this conversation with them about a
year ago, gave the advice that you've
just given there. And about two months
later, this individual who I shame came
to me and I said, "How's your uh you
know, your your your investments going
in that in that fund?"
>> And they said, "Oh, yeah. I had bills.
had a credit card bill, so I I took took
it out.
>> Oh, yeah. She she treated it like a
checking account. Investments for me are
places to accumulate wealth. I don't
draw from it. That's what a checking
account is for. So, if what that is is
there's two parts to what your friend is
saying. One is um mentally she's
thinking that this investment account is
just money I can draw from if I need it.
So, I would sort of gently change the
way she thinks about it. The second is I
guarantee her account structure is a
little
um subpar. So here's how I would set it
up. This is in chapter five. Uh it's all
automation cuz trust me, I don't want to
spend time transferring money back and
forth. That's I don't spend any time on
that. You get paid, your money goes into
your checking account. From your
checking account, it is automatically
transferred to a savings account. In
fact, I have subsavings accounts for
vacation, car, down payment, all that
stuff. So, you have money set up for
specific goals. Money is transferred to
your investment account. It's
transferred there. I'm not going to
touch that money. I'm going to let it
cook. And then I have my guilt-free
spending, which is going out with
friends, whatever I love, and my credit
card bill is automatically paid off
every single month. That's how you want
to set it up. It takes a couple of weeks
to set everything up and then you never
have to think about it again. C
>> how can you prove to me that this is the
way to make wealth? What case studies
have you got that investing in funds
>> over a long period of time is the path
to financial wealth because you know
it's you said earlier about the paint
drying thing. The narrative that we see
about how why people and how people get
rich is, you know, they sell a company
or they have a lottery win or maybe they
buy some cryptocurrency and it goes up.
>> Yeah.
>> That's what we hear. So that's what we
try and emulate.
>> Totally. We
>> prove to me that that's that this fund
strategy is better.
>> Well, there's there's a couple things.
First off, the research over more than a
hundred about a hundred years shows the
returns of the stock market. And the
returns tend to be at least in America
they tend to be around 11%
10 to 11% and if you take out inflation
you get about 7 to 8%. Per year. Now for
anyone listening they go okay well what
does that mean? That number means
nothing to me. 7% whatever. If you go
right now and you Google investment
calculator and you just plug in your
age, you plug in let's say 200 300 bucks
a month and you plug in 7% return and
you just watch how that money grows.
You will be shocked.
>> Jack, get me my phone. I'm going to do
it now.
>> Okay. So, let's search for compound
interest calculator. And there's a
really simple one. This it's called
Money Chimp.
>> Okay.
Okay, I've got it. All right.
>> All right. So, there's four numbers we
need to fill out here. Let's take a
look. The first is current principal.
That means how much you've got in the
bank.
>> I'm going to say
$5,000 and I'm going to start when I was
16. Cuz if id saved my money when I was
16 and not spent irres recklessly, I
think I could have had that $5,000 when
I was 16. Um, annual addition. What does
that mean?
>> How much can you invest per year? So,
for most people, they think about on a
monthly basis. They might say 200 bucks
a month, which would be $2,400 annual
edition.
>> Okay. So, what do you want to say?
>> I'm going to say, can I say $5,000?
>> Yeah, that's, you know, about 400 bucks
a month. I think that's reasonable. I
often find that with people making uh
median or slightly above median salary
that there are hundreds of dollars a
month of money that is unaccounted for
that if properly made intentional could
be invested. So great 5,000 a year.
>> All right.
>> Obviously I could have once I got past a
certain age I could have increased that
though. So
>> we're going to talk about that. Hold on
to that idea.
>> Okay.
>> How many years? This was you at 20.
>> This was me at 16.
>> Oh okay. And how old are you today?
>> 30.
>> Okay. So 14 years. Let's just do it
until today and we'll see what happens.
>> Okay.
>> All right.
>> 14 years.
>> And then it says interest rate. So what
should we assume for that?
>> Is that 8%.
>> Yeah. 7 to eight. I you I do seven just
to be super conservative because I never
want to be surprised on the downside,
>> right?
>> If anything, I'm going to make more. So
7%. All right. Let's calculate it.
>> Okay. What do you see?
>> Damn.
>> What do you see?
>> $133,000.
537.
>> Yeah, that's what you would have had
right now. Now, let's add some context.
>> So, this is really important. You see a
number that says $133,000
at age 30.
>> Yeah.
>> Okay. Is that a lot? Is that not? Hm. I
don't know. Let's break it down. At that
point, you started with $5,000 and you
invested $5,000 per year. We assumed no
raises even though you obviously made
more than you made at age 16.
>> We assumed you stopped investing at age
30, which is obviously ridiculous.
And you end up with six figures. Let's
play it out. Let's take it until
40.
So instead of 14 years, you invested for
24 years. What do you see?
I would have $336,000.
>> It's getting better
>> from just $5,000 a year.
>> Not much.
>> It's fantastic.
>> Again, 400 bucks or so a month is very
modest. Remember, people's income goes
up typically in their 30s and 40s.
>> And if you already are investing a
little bit automatically, all you have
to do is just tweak a number and it will
take an extra couple hundred, three,
four, 500 bucks.
>> Let's do one more. Let's go to 34 years
just because I want to see what happens.
and then we're going to play with the
other numbers.
>> Okay. So, investing from the age of 16
until I'm 50,
>> I would have $736,000
in my account.
>> Yeah. Now, I want to do the full the
full thing. I want to do a more
realistic number here. So, instead of
50, we're going to go
49 years.
That takes you to age 65.
>> Yeah.
>> Okay. and instead of $5,000 per year,
your income obviously went up from being
16 years old. So, I'm going to pick a
number out of thin air and and I'm going
to tell you how I picked it. I'm going
to say instead of $5,000 a year, it's
actually going to be
$30,000 per year. Let me tell you why I
picked that.
In your early years, you don't have as
much money, but you were still investing
a little bit, which shows that you're
dedicated. as your income goes up,
you're going to start proportionally
continuing to invest. So, at a certain
point, your income will be really high,
and that will bring that average up.
That's why I switched it to 30,000 per
year. I actually think this is quite
modest, but I'm going to go ahead and do
it.
So, here we have someone starting
investing at $5,000. They invest $30,000
per year.
Okay? They grow it for 49 years at 7%.
Do you know the math?
>> No. Tell me.
>> 12,33,000.
>> So that's me starting with 5K gradually
ratcheting it up until I'm investing
well investing 30k on year a year per
average across those 49 years.
>> Yes. Which is a flaw in this because
it's so simple that money invested.
You're not actually going to invest that
much early on. you'll invest more later.
Yeah. So, you won't actually you'll
maybe have a marginal amount less, but
we're talking 10 versus 12 million.
That's a lot of money.
>> And then if I got 8% instead of the 7%,
I'd have 17.4 million.
>> Yeah, but don't mess with that.
>> This is what this is what people do.
They go, "Well, if I got 13%, I'm going
to invest in this PE fund." I go, "Don't
do that. You're going to lose all your
money. Just stop."
>> Yeah.
>> 7% is safe. It's conservative. That's
why I am here. That's why I want to
encourage people. You don't need to
juice your returns. I hope you do get
8%. But I don't want you to count on
that. I want you to count on safe,
stable returns. And what matters for you
is the time you started early and the
amount. If you love the D CEO brand and
