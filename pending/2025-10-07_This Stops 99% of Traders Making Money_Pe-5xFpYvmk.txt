Stop using indicators right now because
they won't just slow you down. They'll
cost you thousands of dollars trading.
You see, after over 11 years of trading
full-time and helping thousands of
students through online trading campus,
I've seen one thing ruin more traders
than anything else. Indicators. The very
tools that are supposed to help you are
often the reasons you start losing
money. Today, I'm going to show you
three things. Number one, why using
indicators can lose you thousands of
dollars. Number two, how professionals
actually find high probability supply
and demand zones. And number three, a
clever way to use indicators without
losing money. But before we tear
indicators apart, we need to be on the
same page about why so many traders rely
on them in the first place. Then we'll
get into exactly why they fail and
finally what to do instead. Why traders
rely on indicators. Indicators feel
safe. They simplify chaos into neat
signals. Buy here, sell there. For
beginners, that feels like a road map in
a world that otherwise looks random. A
chart loaded with indicators looks
professional. It feels objective. It
takes away the fear of making decisions
on your own. In other words, indicators
give the illusion of certainty in a
business built on uncertainty. That
comfort is tempting, but that comfort
comes at a cost. Why indicators actually
stop you making money? Here's the truth
you need to hear. Reason number one,
they lag. Indicators summarize past
price, so they're always behind. By the
time MACD crosses, the move is already
underway. By the time RSI flashes
overbought, smart money is already
preparing to step in on the other side.
You are reacting, not anticipating.
Reason number two, they contradict. One
signal says buy, another says sell.
Another says wait, it's chaos. The more
you load up, the more confusing it gets.
Shots turn into Christmas trees.
colorful, flashing, impressive looking,
and useless when it's time to make a
decision. All of those tools are derived
from price. So, price must move first
before the indicator reacts. You're
always late to a party institutions
already started. Reason number three,
they paralyze you. More tools, less
confidence. You wait for confirmation
that never comes or you jump on a
flashing signal with no grasp of the
bigger picture. Many retail traders even
believe the market moves because an
indicator flashed a signal. It doesn't.
Markets move because of fundamentals and
institutions execute through supply and
demand, not because an indicator told
them to click buy or sell. And here's
the most dangerous part. Indicators
sometimes work. Sometimes convinces you
there's a code to crack. You double down
after a few lucky winners. then it fails
and you don't know why. You end up
chasing signals instead of building a
repeatable process. Consistency never
shows up. The secret, a two-step
mechanical process, fundamentals and
timing. Professionals strip away noise
and follow a clear mechanical process
that mirrors how institutions operate.
Step number one, build your market bias
using fundamentally derived indicators,
not price derived tools. I'm talking
about what drives price. Coot report to
see where smart money is positioned and
what retail, the dumb money is doing.
Seasonal tendencies, valuation models to
spot fair value. Together, these form a
professional toolkit for directional
bias. If you want a deep dive, comment
below. I might start a series on reading
the CO report. Step number two, time the
market using supply and demand.
Institutions don't buy because RSI hit
30 or sell because MACD crossed. They
transact where they can move sides at
zones of imbalance. Not all zones are
equal. Some are weak and retailable.
Others are strong, untouched, and
explosive. Your edge is filtering the
weak out and focusing only on
institutional footprints. Bring both
steps together and you have a complete
trading ecosystem. Fundamentals for
bias. Sublime demand for timing. The CIF
framework covered imbalance freshness.
Use this professional filter to separate
weak from the strong zones. C stands for
covered multi-time frame big brother
small brother. The best setups occur
when a higher time frame big brother
zone covers a lower time frame smaller
brother zone. Enter on the smaller
brother for a tighter zone and a better
risk-to-reward proposition. But stay
aligned with the big brother for
institutional strength. The big brother
wins. If you want the full breakdown,
watch my video, the number one supply
and demand trading rule that makes you a
pro instantly. Full course. I stands for
imbalance. Strong zones show a clean
base and a decisive leg out that leaves
a sharp imbalance. Big candles, strong
departure, minimal overlap. That's the
institutional footprint. Weak zones
drift, stairst step, and wick. That's
retail. F stands for freshness. Strong
zones are fresh and untouched with
orders likely resting. Once institutions
fill, they rarely defend the same zone
multiple times. Each retest erodess the
footprint and the edge. Weak versus
strong zones. Price action walk through.
Most beginners mark five, six, even 10
levels. Every pause gets a line. Apply
covered, imbalance, freshness, and most
of those vanish. Week one, messy base,
overlapping candles, shallow departure,
retail footprint. Week two looks clean,
but it's already been tested multiple
times. Freshness is gone. Strong, clean
base, explosive leg out, sharp
imbalance, untouched, institutional
footprints intact. This is where smart
money loaded. This is where we build
trades. Focus only on strong zones and
your chart goes from chaos to clarity.
Practical application. Building a trade,
the trading ecosystem. Here's how to
turn this into a blend. Step number one,
top-down analysis. Start with higher
time frames where institutions leave the
biggest footprints. If your zone isn't
aligned with your higher time frame,
you're trading against the tide. Step
number two, zone selection. Apply
covered imbalance freshness. Mark only
strong zones. Step number three,
risk-to-reward plan. Trading is a math
problem. If the payoff isn't asymmetric,
skip it. Risk $1 to make $120. The math
doesn't work. Risk $1 to make two or $3.
Now, you can be wrong more often and
still grow. We never settle for less
than one to two and ideally one to three
or better. Step number four, execution.
Once the zone and your risk-to-reward
are confirmed, drop to your entry time
frame. Place the order inside the zone
using the preferred or the wider version
of that lower time frame zone. Stop goes
beyond the base. Target the next
opposing imbalance. Step number five,
set and forget. When the plan is set,
walk away. Do not babysit every candle.
The more you interfere, the more
emotions take over. Let the math do its
work. Mindset shift. what the 1% know.
Trading isn't about being right. It's
about being profitable. Most traders
chase certainty with indicators,
signals, and confirmations.
Professionals structure trades so
winners are bigger than losers. If you
sell for $1 and make $2 back, you don't
care if half of your trades fail. You
can lose half and still be profitable
long-term at 1 to3. This is what
separates the 99% from the 1%. How to
actually use indicators the right way?
Don't professionals use indicators yet,
but not as signals. Professionals decide
using fundamentals for bias and supply
and demand for timing. Indicators can
support that decision, not replace it.
Moving averages useful to visualize
slope after you confirm direction via
higher time frame structure and supply
and demand. They smooth the picture.
They do not define the trade. volume or
orderflow tools helpful to highlight
liquidity pockets around your zones.
They add context on where participation
may increase. But the zone comes first.
Without the zone, volume is just noise.
Golden rule. Indicators should never
decide the trade. Fundamentals build
your bias. Supply and demand zones
define timing. Institutional footprints
confirm execution. Indicators can only
support what is already clear. Flip this
mindset and you stop trading like
retail. You start thinking like
institutions. Indicators look like
shortcuts but they lag. They contradict
and they create dependency. They blind
you to what drives the market. Markets
move because of fundamentals, interest
rates, monetary policy, institutional
positioning. Fundamentals set the bias.
Technicals time the entries. We use
supply and demand zones to read
institutional footprints and pick our
spots. Not all zones are equal. Your
edge is covered. Imbalance freshness.
Combine strong zones with proper
risk-to-reward proposition. Then let the
probabilities play out. Keep indicators
only as supportive context, never as a
decision maker. Do less but better.
Trade less, filter harder. Demand
asymmetric risk-to-reward. Align with
institutions, not retail noise. Do that
consistently and you stop making the
mistakes that hold back 99% of traders.
