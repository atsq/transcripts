On Friday the 10th of October, the crypto market 
experienced its own Black Friday. In a matter of
hours, over $19 billion was wiped from existence. 
More than 1.6 million traders were liquidated,
and it was all triggered by a single post on 
social media. This was the largest liquidation
event in crypto history, and it's left many 
asking the same question. Is the bull market
over? Is it over? Well, today we're going 
to cut through the FUD and give you the full
story. We'll break down the minute-by-minute 
timeline of the crash and explain why it was
so devastating. We'll dive into the geopolitical 
chess match between the US and China that lit the
fuse. And we'll examine the mounting evidence 
of insider trading. Most importantly though,
we'll tell you what this means for Bitcoin, 
altcoins, and your portfolio as we head into a
very uncertain week. My name is Guy and you're 
watching the Coin Bureau. First up though,
I'm not a financial adviser and nothing in this 
video should be considered financial advice. This
is educational content meant to inform you about 
the recent crypto market crash and its potential
implications. If that sounds good, hit that like 
button and let's get into it. Let's get to it. So,
to understand the sheer violence of this crash, 
we first need to set the scene. Early last week,
the market was pretty euphoric. Bitcoin had just 
printed fresh all-time highs above $126,000 and
sentiment was overwhelmingly bullish. By Friday 
morning, BTC was still trading comfortably above
$122,000. But behind the scenes, the geopolitical 
tectonic plates were shifting. On Thursday
the 9th of October, China announced new 
export controls on rare earth minerals,
a critical component in everything from iPhones 
to F-35 fighter jets. This was a strategic power
play by Beijing and it did not go unnoticed. On 
Friday morning, President Trump fired his first
warning shot on Truth Social, threatening a quote 
massive increase in tariffs on Chinese goods. This
initial threat was enough to rattle the markets 
with Wall Street's fear gauge, the VIX, soaring
32%. And Bitcoin began to bleed, dipping from 
the $122,000 level to around $117,000. But that
was just the appetizer. The main course arrived 
later that afternoon. In a second decisive post,
Trump declared that the United States would 
impose a 100% tariff on all Chinese imports,
quote, over and above any tariff that they are 
currently paying. Trump hit the send button and
the floor fell out of the crypto market. Bitcoin 
fell $3,000 almost instantaneously, but that was
just the beginning of a historic liquidation 
cascade. Within hours, BTC flash crashed to
lows of $14,500, even touching $12,000 on some 
exchanges. In a single day, the world's biggest
cryptocurrency had dropped by $20,000. Altcoins, 
meanwhile, were absolutely eviscerated. Ethereum
plunged 21% from its highs, while majors like XRP, 
Salana, and Dogecoin crashed between 20 and 30%.
Others like Cardano, Chainlink, and Ave fell 
as much as 40%. So then why was this crash so
incredibly severe? Well, it was the perfect 
storm of extreme leverage, very poor timing,
and failing infrastructure. For weeks, leverage 
had been building up to precarious levels. Just
before the crash, Bitcoin open interest had surged 
to a record high of over $94 billion. Think of it
like a skyscraper built on shaky foundations and 
Trump's post as the earthquake that brought the
whole structure down. The announcement also hit 
on a Friday afternoon, a period of notoriously low
liquidity when traditional markets are closing. 
This created a domino effect. As the price fell,
leverage long positions were automatically force 
sold by exchanges. These massive sell orders push
the price down further, triggering even more 
liquidations in a vicious downward spiral. In
total, a staggering $19.1 billion in leverage 
positions was wiped out in just 24 hours. Now,
to put that into some perspective, the infamous 
COVID crash of March 2020 saw just $1.2 billion
in liquidations. The FTX collapse triggered around 
$1.6 billion. So this event was nearly 20 times
larger than the COVID panic and it impacted over 
1.6 million individual traders. The carnage was
amplified by the very exchanges meant to provide 
stability. High-profile traders reported that
major platforms like Binance, Coinbase, and 
Robin Hood experienced technical issues with
order books freezing and stop-loss functions 
being disabled at the most critical moments.
So this technical failure turned a sharp 
correction into an allout market collapse. Now
while Trump's post was the trigger, he claimed the 
move came quote out of the blue. But in reality,
this trade war has been bubbling up for 
months. The core of the dispute revolves
around long-standing US grievances over unfair 
trade practices and intellectual property theft by
China. Trump's second term has seen him reignite 
this conflict with a vengeance. And China's latest
move to restrict rare earth minerals was a direct 
shot at a key US vulnerability. An attempt to gain
leverage ahead of a planned meeting between Trump 
and President Xi at the Apex summit at the end of
this month. Trump publicly embarrassed after 
previously claiming the rare earth issue was
quote done, retaliated with his signature move, 
massive unpredictable tariffs. It's a highstakes
game of geopolitical brinksmanship and the crypto 
market just got caught in the crossfire. But the
sheer perfection of the timing of this crash has 
led many to suspect something more sinister than
just a geopolitical spat. So was there insider 
trading? Well, the evidence is compelling. On
the derivatives exchange Hyperlquid, one whale 
wallet executed a series of perfectly timed trades
that netted them a reported profit of nearly $200 
million. Blockchain analysis shows this trader,
identified as a Bitcoin OG, who has held coins 
since 2011, began building massive short positions
against BTC and ETH just days before the crash. 
Then they doubled down on these shorts just 30
minutes before Trump's tariff announcement. This 
uncanny timing has led to rampant speculation.
Was this simply a savvy macro trader reading the 
tea leaves or did someone get an early whisper
of Trump's plan? Prominent crypto attorneys are 
already calling for a full investigation. And hey,
who can blame them? So, with the market in 
turmoil, the multi-billion dollar question is
where do we go from here? Can Bitcoin and altcoins 
recover? Well, let's start with the good news.
Despite the chaos, Bitcoin held the critical 
$100,000 support zone. After a brief dip below
$12,000, it quickly bounced back and has since 
stabilized in the $110 to $113,000 range.
So this tells us that the crash was primarily a 
derivativesled leverage flush, not a fundamental
breakdown in spot market conviction. In fact, 
onchain data shows that institutions saw this
as a massive buying opportunity. Black Rockck's 
spot ETF reportedly scooped up over 21,000 BTC mid
chaos, and XRP Wales added over a billion tokens 
to their bags during the dip. This suggests that
the smart money believes the long-term bull 
run is still very much alive. The fundamentals
have not changed. Only sentiment and leverage 
have. This event has brutally reset the market,
clearing out the excessive greed and creating a 
much healthier foundation for a sustainable climb.
However, that said, the path forward is far from 
certain for altcoins. Meanwhile, the picture is
a lot more concerning. The carnage was so severe 
that many are asking if altcoin season is now over
before it even truly began. The altcoin season 
index has fallen to 55, well below the 75point
threshold that signals a true alt season. Bitcoin 
dominance has spiked as capital has fled to the
relative safety of the king. This doesn't mean 
altcoins can't recover, but it does suggest that
the days of everything pumps are likely behind 
us. The next alt run will probably be much more
selective driven by specific narratives like for 
instance AI real world assets or upcoming spot
ETF approvals for tokens like Salana and XRP. And 
this brings us to the single biggest variable that
will dictate the market's direction for the rest 
of the year and beyond. Donald Trump. The entire
recovery timeline is now dependent on geopolitical 
headlines. When are these trade issues likely to
be resolved? Well, the short answer is nobody 
knows. Trump has set a 1st of November deadline
for the tariffs, which does provide a few weeks 
of negotiating room before the apex summit on the
31st of October. And history shows us that Trump 
often uses extreme threats as a negotiating tactic
before later backing down. A strategy some have 
called the taco trade. Trump always chickens out.
So he could very well walk back these tariffs 
in exchange for a concession or two from China.
However, his first trade war from 2018 took a full 
18 months to reach a phase 1 deal. Investors must
now price in the risk that this could be a long 
drawn out conflict. If trade tensions persist,
the crypto sell-off could evolve into a broader 
macro correction. If they ease, we could see a
powerful relief rally. The market is now hanging 
on every tweet, every headline, and every rumor.
So, to wrap it all up, the shocking crash on 
the 10th of October was triggered by Trump's
100% tariff threat on China, but it was fueled 
by the most extreme leverage buildup in crypto
history. This created the largest liquidation 
event ever recorded, wiping out over $19 billion
and affecting more than 1.6 million traders. While 
the evidence of insider trading is highly suspect,
it remains unproven. The good news is that the 
structural bull market drivers remain intact.
Institutional players bought the dip and the crash 
served as a much needed leverage reset. However,
the recovery is now hostage to the whims of 
geopolitical negotiations. The path forward
will be volatile, unpredictable, and entirely 
dependent on headlines. The bull market is not
over, folks. But the rules of the game have 
changed. The rules have changed. And if you
