So, why are so many people suddenly
talking about creatine? Creatine first
hit the market back in 1993. Athletes
were already taking it and using it in
1992 in the Barcelona Olympics and by
the mid 1990s, it was literally on the
shelves of stores everywhere. It quickly
became one of the top sports supplements
in the world and it hasn't gone away. In
the late 1990s, Bill Phillips Body for
Life program was hugely influential in
bringing creatine out of the
bodybuilding world and into mainstream
fitness. Before Body for Life, Phillips
had already founded EAS, which was
experimental and applied sciences. It
was a sports supplement company, and he
launched it in the early 1990s selling a
product called Phosphogen, which was the
first widely marketed creatine product
in the United States. So then came his
book, Body for Life in 1999. Wasn't just
a workout plan. It was a full lifestyle
program, nutrition, supplements,
mindset, and creatine was a central part
of it. The book sold more than 3 million
copies worldwide. It hit number one on
the New York Times bestseller list, and
it was tied to the body for life
transformation challenge programs, which
drew thousands of participants every
year, men and women. And that visibility
was massive. Suddenly, creatine wasn't
just for gym rats anymore. It was
something that your neighbor, your
coworker, or even your 50-year-old dad
might be talking about. And by the end
of the 1990s, creatine was a $200
million industry in the US alone.
Surveys showed that as many as 40% of
college athletes and a surprisingly
large number of high school athletes had
tried creatine. That was a huge jump
from almost zero awareness pre93
to a blockbuster supplement by the
decades in. What Bill Phillips did so
well was to tie the use of creatine to
the story of physical transformation
with thousands of before and after
photos of real people going through
12-week challenges with visible changes
to their strength, to their physiques,
and to their confidence. The Body for
Life Challenge helped consolidate
creatine as a tool not just for elite
athletes, but for ordinary men and women
looking for real change and results.
Even after Philip sold EAS to Abbott
Labs in 2004, creatine's momentum didn't
stop there. Instead, it became a
mainstream supplement, which has only
grown in popularity over time. But
here's why it's in the spotlight today.
Today, we're not just talking about
athletes anymore. Creatine is being
studied in older adults, in clinical
rehabilitation, even in brain and
cardiac health. There have now been over
680 clinical trials on creatine
supplementation. Most of them using the
most common form, which is creatine
monohydrate, looking at muscle growth,
brain function, cardiac health, and
more. So, if you're in your 50s, your
60s, or even in your 70s, know this.
Creatine is one of the most wellstudied,
safe, and effective supplements found
for protecting muscle and strength as we
age. So, I'm going to break down the
pros and cons, what the research is
saying, and I'll add my perspective as
an ER doctor as well as a weight
management physician and as someone who
also takes creatine myself. So, first of
all, what is creatine really? Well, I
can tell you what it is not. Creatine is
not a steroid. A lot of people think
that creatine is a steroid, and it's
not. Your body actually makes creatine,
and it stores it in your muscles and in
your brain where it helps recycle
energy. The form most people take as a
supplement is called creatine
monohydrate. And so here's the quick
science behind it. The cells of your
body derive energy from a chemical
called ATP or adenosin triphosphate.
It's the battery that powers your cells.
When you use energy, ATP loses a
phosphate group and becomes something
called ADP, adenosin diphosphate. And to
recharge the battery, ADP has to pick up
another phosphate group and turn it back
into ATP. It might seem a little
complicated, but that's where creatine
comes in. Supplemental creatine acts as
a fast phosphate donor, helping to
recharge that ATP battery so that your
muscles in your brain have the energy to
perform work. Now, why does that matter
as we age? Around the age of 40, most of
us begin to lose muscle mass and
strength. The medical term for that loss
is something called sarcopenia. Some
people lose muscle faster, some people
lose it slower, but it happens to
everyone. That's why when you see Arnold
Schwarzenegger, he doesn't look like he
did in his bodybuilding days and back in
his prime. So, left unchecked, muscle
loss leads to frailty. It can lead to
falls and injury and even loss of
independence. But the good news is this.
When creatine is combined with
resistance training, it helps limit and
stave off that decline. Clinical trials
in adults from their 50s through their
80s show improvements in lean mass,
strength, and function. But here's the
catch. Creatine isn't magic. The
benefits only happen if you're lifting
weights and doing strength training. You
can't just take creatine and sit on the
couch and expect to maintain your
muscle. But what about benefits beyond
muscle? Some studies suggest small
improvements in memory and processing
speed, especially in women and groups
with low baseline creatine levels, such
as vegans or vegetarians who don't eat
red meat or fish. And for cardiac
health, they're hopeful things as well.
Creatine levels in the heart muscle of
patients with heart failure are often
lower in these patients. And creatine
supplementation appears to improve
muscle function and exercise tolerance
in these patients as well as reducing
fatigue which supports their efforts in
cardiac rehab. And benefits for the
brain. Creatine has shown
neuroprotective effects helping energy
and metabolism in the brain and possibly
providing benefits after traumatic brain
injury as well as supporting memory,
processing speed and attention. There's
also early but promising clues that it
could help neurologic diseases like
Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and
Huntington's disease. Even in mental
health, there are hints that creatine
may support mood and resilience under
stress. This is really promising stuff.
The research is still young, but it's
exciting to see a supplement that was
once just thought of as for bodybuilders
only, showing signals of benefit across
areas involving aging as well as
physical and neurologic health. Now,
let's talk about safety. For healthy
adults, creatine is considered very
safe. But there are things that you need
to know. Creatine gets converted by the
body into something called creatinine,
and it can falsely skew kidney numbers
that doctors follow in your lab work,
making it appear your kidneys are
stressed, even if they're not. If your
doctor is monitoring lab work for kidney
function because you have high blood
pressure or diabetes, make sure that
they know that you're taking creatine so
that they can interpret your lab results
with clarity. If you already have kidney
disease or you're on multiple
medications, talk to your doctor before
starting creatine. For most people,
creatine side effects are mild and
minimal. Sometimes stomach upset if you
happen to take too much or a little
water weight gain in your muscles.
Rarely. Some people report cramping, but
that's usually combated by keeping
yourself optimally hydrated. From my own
perspective in the ER, I don't really
see creatine emergencies. What I do see
is kidney strain in people who are sick
or taking multiple medications or who
are poorly hydrated. So, if you've been
experiencing vomiting, diarrhea, or
fever, it makes sense to pause creatine
supplementation until you're completely
better. From the weight management side
of things, I've seen patients panic when
the scale jumps up a few pounds, and
usually that's just water weight and not
fat gain. Over time, creatine helps
preserve muscle during weight loss,
which is exactly what most of us want. I
take creatine for the same reason, to
maintain my muscle mass and my overall
strength and even to support my bone
health as I grow older. So, who should
consider taking creatine? If you're in
your 50s, your 60s or older, if you're
doing weight training and you want to
keep your strength and your mobility
high, creatine is worth thinking about.
It's also worth considering if you're a
vegan or a vegetarian and you don't eat
much red meat or fish or any at all. And
especially if you're trying to lose
weight without losing muscle, creatine
can be helpful. So, here are the key
takeaways. Creatine is safe, cheap, and
effective for most healthy older adults.
It works best when paired with
progressive strength training and
adequate protein intake. But if you have
kidney disease or even if you're
perfectly healthy, it's always smart to
check with your doctor first before
starting creatine supplementation or any
supplementation for that matter. So, is
creatine worth it after 50? In my
opinion, yes. Research is growing year
by year, and we're only beginning to
understand the full scope of creatine's
potential benefits. Talk to your doctor.
Let them know which supplements and
over-the-counter medications that you're
taking so that they can take care of you
and they know what's going on. If you
want to know more reasons you should
consider strength training in your 50s,
60s,7s and beyond, watch this video
next. As always, thanks for watching and
please share this video with someone you
feel would benefit from watching it as
well. Be well and I will see you in the
next video.
