In May 2025, news broke in Australia
that the government now treats Bitcoin
as money. For Australian Bitcoiners,
this changed everything because if the
ATO classes Bitcoin the same as
currency, guess what? No capital gains
tax. But there's more going on here than
the headlines would have you believe.
So, in this video, I'm going to break
down the controversial ruling, clear up
where the ATO actually stands on Bitcoin
right now, and show you the tool I've
built to keep you on the right side of
the tax rules, even if they suddenly
change. Plus, I'll debunk some of the
common misconceptions around owning
Bitcoin and crypto in Australia to help
you better understand the rules as they
stand today. First, some background.
Since 2014, the Australian Tax Office
has treated most digital assets as a
capital gains tax asset. If you sell,
swap, or spend crypto, that's usually a
CGT event. For example, buy $20,000
worth of Bitcoin and sell for 60,000,
that $40,000 gain is subject to capital
gains tax. And if you hold for more than
12 months, you may be eligible for the
50% CGT discount. Income like staking
rewards or airdrops is typically
accessible when you receive it. And
later when you dispose of those assets,
there's a CGT outcome as well. In May
2025, a Victorian criminal case
described Bitcoin as money. That
surprised a lot of people because it
clashes with the ATO's long-standing
approach that crypto is property and
therefore a CGT asset. Naturally, the
question popped up. Could this mean no
CGT on Bitcoin? Maybe even a refunds.
But here's the nuance. This was not a
civil tax case. It was a state level
criminal matter. Different context,
different weights. It doesn't
automatically change federal tax
administration. It's also under appeal,
so we don't even know if the reasoning
will stand up in higher courts yet. Four
fast facts to keep in mind. First, a
state criminal decision doesn't rewrite
national tax law. Second, it isn't
binding across Australia for tax
purposes. Third, it's under appeal and
may be narrowed or overturned. Fourth,
the ATO guidance remains unchanged.
Crypto is still treated as a CGT asset
today. So, if you're lodging a return,
you must continue reporting according to
current ATO rules. Even if nothing
changed today, the case highlights a
bigger reality. Rules can shift quickly.
If higher courts or parliament later
confirm a Bitcoin as money view, the
treatment could change fast. And if your
records are messy, especially with
dollar cost averaging, frequent swaps,
and staking, trying to reconstruct cost
bases after the fact is an absolute
nightmare. Don't do that to future you.
Let me explain with some examples. If we
open up NEX here and take a look at this
Bitcoin holding, we'll jump across to
the trades tab. You can see we've got a
whole lot of trades in here. Every time
you trade crypto for another crypto,
it's a CGT event. So in this case, we
traded some of this Bitcoin holding for
Ethereum, that triggers a capital gains
tax event. Then later up here, when we
traded back in from Ethereum, that's
another CGT event. If you've also been
dollar cost averaging or buying into the
same crypto multiple times, each one of
these trades comes with its own date,
its own price, its own quantity, its own
fee, and its own cost base. So when you
go to calculate the capital gain event
on some of these CGT events, you need to
know what the cost base is because for
example, when this Ethereum record came
in, you need to be able to calculate
whether it's a capital gain or loss
based off all the trades you've done
before. So that's why keeping these
records super accurate is critical in
making your tax return accurate for the
ATO. Here's your four-step plan until
the appeals finish and the ATO updates
anything. Step one, keep reporting
crypto under current ATO guidance. CGT
still applies. Step two, centralize your
history. So, pull everything from the
exchanges, wallets, and the onchain
activity into one system. Step three,
back fill gaps now. Export CSVs and
statements before platforms change
formats or shut down. And step four, use
a tracking tool. I use NVXA obviously so
you can pivot quickly if legal
interpretations change. But three
signposts are worth watching for. First,
the appeal outcome. That's the big one.
Second, any ATO statement updating
guidance. Third, possible legislation
clarifying crypto status. If any of
these move, tax treatment could update,
but not retroactively guaranteed. So,
keep your records bulletproof. Now,
let's clear up a few common
misconceptions because if you get this
wrong, it can cost you big time.
Misconception one, Bitcoin is tax-free
if I don't cash out to dollars. Not
true. The ATO says selling, swapping, or
spending Bitcoin is a CGT event, even if
you never touch AUD. If you swap Bitcoin
to Ethereum, that's taxable. Buy
something with Bitcoin, taxable.
Misconception two, if I use a crypto
debit card, I avoid tax. Nope, those
cards are just automating disposals. So
every time you tap, the system is
selling a slice of your crypto for fiat.
That's still a disposal, which means a
CGT event. Misconception three, the ATO
can't track onchain transactions.
Absolutely false. The ATO has data
matching programs with Australian
exchanges, plus blockchain analytics
tools. They've issued thousands of
letters to taxpayers reminding them to
declare crypto gains. So if you're
assuming they won't see it, you're
betting against the house. Misconception
four. If Bitcoin becomes money, the ATO
will refund my past tax. Unlikely. Tax
law changes generally aren't retroactive
unless parliament specifically
legislates it. So if the treatment
changes tomorrow, it won't rewrite your
previous returns. So if you've heard any
of these myths, you now know the
reality. Crypto is taxed today under
current ATO rules and you need to track
every transaction until that changes.
This is why while it might be convenient
or exciting to believe that the
Victorian criminal ruling has suddenly
changed the Bitcoin or crypto rules in
Australia, the reality is that the rules
are pretty much as they have been since
2014. Bitcoin is not tax-free in
Australia, at least not yet. The
Victorian ruling stirred the pot, but
atto rules remain. Crypto is a CGT asset
today like property. If you want to be
ready for whatever comes next, track
everything in NEXA link in the
description. But tell me in the
comments, do you think Bitcoin should be
treated as money in Australia?
