So, there's something big happening to
the world right now that almost no one
is talking about. And I think in the
long term, this is going to change the
way we all live our lives. And I'm
talking about digital ID.
>> This government will make a new free of
charge digital ID mandatory for the
right to work by the end of this
parliament.
Let me spell that out. You will not be
able to work in the United Kingdom if
you do not have digital ID.
>> Now, it might sound like it has nothing
to do with economics or finance and
maybe it sounds boring, but the truth is
this is one of the most important
changes that governments are pushing
right now and it's happening almost
everywhere at the exact same time. In
the US, at least 25 states have already
launched digital driver's license
programs. That means you can now pull
out your phone instead of your wallet
when you check into a flight, for
example. And in Europe, they passed a
law last year that makes it a
requirement for all member countries to
roll out a national digital ID wallet by
2026. In China, they just launched their
version this summer, which links it to
their social credit system. Countries
like South Korea, Singapore, Nigeria,
the United Arab Emirates are already
doing this with their digital IDs. Now,
you might have heard of digital IDs
before, but I don't think most people
really understand what it is because
it's not being debated or talked about
in Congress. It's not really trending on
CNBC, and most people probably don't
even realize that this is actually
happening. But what's interesting though
is that the United Nations has made it
one of their goals, quote, legal
identity for all by 2030. And the people
funding it, of course, the World
Economic Forum and the World Bank. And
now Europe and the US are writing all of
this into law. In just the last decade,
the number of national digital ID
programs have doubled. Today, over a
hundred countries either have one or are
building one right now. And when I first
thought about it, at least on paper, it
sounds kind of nice. It promises to cut
down on fraud and make travel easier.
And it onboards about a billion people
who don't have any legal ID. But once
you look into how much power this will
give the governments of the world,
you're going to be shocked. Once your
entire identity is digital, whoever
controls that ID can control a lot of
power. And I don't think RFK Jr. is
exaggerating when he said that this is
turnkey totalitarianism.
It lays the groundwork for global
medical surveillance of every human
being.
>> So in today's video, I want to help
explain exactly what this is, how it's
going to work, how it's going to tie
into our financial lives, and what you
should be prepared for. So with that
said, let's get into it. Hi, my name is
Andre Jick. Hope you're doing well.
Comfort the finance and stay for digital
IDs. So before I get into the details of
how governments are planning to roll
this out, let me first explain what a
digital ID actually is because I think
when most people hear that, they just
imagine it's it's a picture of your
driver's license saved to your phone.
And it kind of is that, but it's also a
lot more than that. So a digital ID is a
secure electronic form of ID that
verifies who you are. Usually it's built
on top of an app on your phone and
inside that app is all your personal
information which is then verified by a
trusted authority like a company or a
government. But there is a big
difference between the physical version
and the digital one because digital IDs
use something called biometric data
which are things like your facial
recognition or fingerprints. with
cryptographic encryption. So, they're a
lot harder to fake. And once you've been
verified, that ID becomes reusable. That
means you don't have to keep handing
over your passport or your license to
different companies or even go to the
DMV. You can just share that specific
piece of information that they need. So,
for example, if a bar needs to know that
you're over 21, the app could just say,
"Yes, this person is old enough without
necessarily revealing your exact
details, your birthday or your full ID
number." So, on paper, it sounds like a
convenient thing to have. It's more
secure. There's less information
floating around, so less chance for
fraud. But as you're about to find out,
you're going to realize that when you
centralize that much power, the question
becomes, what can they do with it?
Because while governments and tech
companies present this as a convenient
and secure thing to have, the actual way
it's already being used in some
countries is a very different story.
>> We're constantly recording, watching,
and recording everything that's going
on. citizens will be on their best
behavior because we're constantly
recording and reporting everything
that's going on.
>> Take China for example. Just this
summer, they launched their national
digital ID app, but instead of it just
being an upgrade from physical to
digital, they tied it to their social
credit system. That means their digital
ID is not just proof of who they are,
but it's also connected to things like
their financial history, travel rights,
and even their online activity. So, what
that means is if the government doesn't
like what they're doing or doesn't like
what they're saying online, or maybe
what they're buying, they could restrict
your ability to travel, to buy those
things, or to access certain social
services. After being sued for
defamation by the subject of a story
he'd written, he was blacklisted. He
only realized when he tried to buy a
train ticket and was told he was banned
from traveling.
>> If you didn't get a vaccine that the
government mandated, sorry, you can't
use public transportation.
>> They would immediately detect that and
send you a notification and they would
deduct money from your what they call
WeChat account. They they use two main
apps, WeChat and Alip Pay. So, you can
actually deduct your money directly from
your account.
There were reports of elderly people and
workers who were denied food and
pensions because their fingerprint
scanners stopped working. So, if the
system doesn't recognize you, you don't
get food. That's kind of crazy.
>> And I have to pass facial recognition,
identity verification,
which is insane because all I want to do
is just spend my gift card balance on
this debit card. These are realworld
examples of how powerful and dangerous
this can be when your whole identity is
digital. And this is just scratching the
surface. Before I tell you how these
systems can really be abused, what I
found really interesting is just how
fast they're putting these systems into
place. Like I don't remember anyone
having this debate or even talking about
it. And when they do, coverage is
sometimes different depending on where
you look. And that's why I use the
sponsor of today's video, Ground News.
It's a platform I actually used while
researching this story and ground news
pulled together 316 different articles
on this headline. Starmer backs UKwide
digital ID to verify right to work and
rent. And what's interesting is that
both the left and the right agreed. The
only real difference was how they framed
it. Left-leaning outlets said digital
IDs threaten privacy and personal
freedoms and they will fail in stopping
illegal immigration. Right-leaning
outlets also argued digital IDs infringe
on citizens privacy. and center outlets
reported it as a modernization effort
that could streamline access to services
with less emotion. But what I love most
is that ground news makes this super
easy to see. You get a bias distribution
chart that looks like this one here,
plus blind spot warnings that show you
the stories your side might not even be
seeing. And in this case, what stands
out to me is that even when both sides
agree something is a big deal, it's
still not getting a lot of attention. So
that's the value in seeing the full
picture. And if you want to step outside
the echo chamber and really understand
what's going on, go to ground.news/jick
or click the link down below. You'll get
40% off the same Vantage plan I use and
you'll be supporting independent
journalism and helping my channel out.
But the point is the system's already
here and it's being rolled out country
by country. So in the European Union,
for example, they already passed
something called EIDS 2.0, know, which
is a law that basically makes it a
requirement for all countries in the
European Union to offer a national
digital ID wallet by 2026. So, in just
about a year or two, every single person
in Europe will have access to one
governmentbacked app that can log you
into your bank and pay your taxes. And
it's being sold as kind of a universal
login for life in Europe. In the UK, for
example, their prime minister Kier
Dharmmer, he wants to make these digital
IDs a mandatory requirement for
everyone.
>> We need to be really clear. You must
have uh ID, mandatory digital ID in
order to work because we have to stop
illegal working.
>> Now, here in the United States, we don't
have one national system yet, but we're
getting a lot closer. At least 25 states
already have mobile driver's licenses
and 20 others are working on them and
even tech companies like Uber and Amazon
are starting to accept them.
>> Because you're anonymous online, it can
be worse. I do think over time, you
know, with things like deep fakes, most
of the time you're online, you're going
to want to be in an environment where
that people are truly identified. That
is, they're connected to a real world
identity that you trust instead of just
people saying whatever they want. And I
think that really shows you how fast
this could change from being this
optional thing to everyone needing this
because it's a law. Now, under the
previous administration under President
Biden, they already issued an executive
order for federal adoption. Now, there's
also other countries that are somewhere
in between like Singapore, for example,
has something called Sing Pass, which is
already being used by more than 4 and
a.5 million people. South Korea also
launched a new app this year and it's
completely replaced their physical cards
for banking. Nigeria is rolling out
their own. And we also have the UAE with
something called the UAE Pass and that's
connected to over 5,000 services.
Everything from signing legal documents
to paying utilities. So you have to ask
yourself, why is all of this happening
now? Like why are governments pushing to
do this right now? And here's what they
say they want out of it. If you ask the
governments or the United Nations or
even the UK why they're doing this,
you're obviously not going to hear them
say control, surveillance, right? But
what they will tell you is that digital
IDs are all about convenience, security,
and inclusion. It's about fighting
illegal immigration, right? So, let me
for a moment take the opposing view and
the government's point of view and try
to sell you on why this is a good thing.
even though ultimately we're going to
see how it's actually being used which
is not good. So the first benefit is
obviously fraud prevention because
identity theft costs billions every year
and paper documents are really easy to
fake. A digital ID uses things like
encryption and biometrics which in
theory makes it a lot harder to steal
and create fakes of. There's also an
element of inclusion because right now
there's almost a billion people in the
world that don't have any legal ID at
all. And without an ID, they can't open
a bank account. They can't vote. They
can't access certain government
benefits. And it's also efficient.
Governments say that this is going to
save them time and money by cutting out
paperwork. That means no more waiting in
line at the DMV, no more mailing forms,
just log in with your ID and you're
done. Estonia, for example, handles 99%
of public services completely digitally.
And they say it saves them around 2% of
GDP every year. And then there's
something called interoperability.
The European Union says that once their
wallet is live, you'll be able to travel
across all the countries, pay taxes, and
even rent a bike with the same app. So
that is the official explanation of why
governments want it. a kind of universal
passport for the digital world, right?
The United Nations has called it the key
to quote sustainable development because
it's supposed to bring everyone into
this system. So on the surface, I think
it sounds completely innocent, but the
reality is that it's anything but that.
Because once you start to really think
about it, the same features that makes
it all convenient are also the same
features that will be abused for power.
And here's exactly why we should be
extremely concerned. Once you centralize
identity into one system, yes, you do
make it easier for people to prove who
they are, but you also make it easier
for governments and corporations and
special interests to track and control
people. We've already seen governments
weaponize financial access against their
own citizens. And you're going to see
this happen in three specific areas.
Government power, corporate power, and
surveillance. So the first example,
government power. If you remember in
2022 during the freedom convoy protests
in Canada, the government used emergency
powers and ordered banks to freeze
accounts linked to protesters. They
targeted regular people who donated
money through GoFundMe. And overnight,
citizens were locked out of their own
savings. There was no trials. There were
no court rulings. No one was convicted
of any wrongdoing. It was just because
they supported the wrong cause. There
was also Georgia earlier this year where
Amnesty International reported that the
government froze the bank accounts of
NOS's and lawyers who were providing
legal aid to protesters and their crime
was offering support to people
exercising their right to protest. So
with the click of a button, the
government just silenced people by
cutting off access to their money. And
under existing anti-money laundering
laws, this is super easy to justify
because banks are required to freeze or
flag accounts that they suspect have
unusual activity. But what counts as
unusual activity? And who gets to decide
that? That could mean transferring money
to buy Bitcoin. It could mean donating
to a protest movement. It could even
mean participating in the boycott of a
company that the government wants to
protect. None of this has to be proven
illegal in court. As long as they have
suspicion, that is enough. And that's a
very scary thing. Now, the second place
you're going to see this power is
corporate power. Again, Amazon and Uber
and other companies are already
experimenting with digital IDs. But once
it becomes the standard, it will stop
being just identification. It will
become what some people call a super
cookie, right? Like think about how a
website uses cookies to track your
browsing and sell you ads, right? But
now apply that across your entire
identity. That opens the door to
something called dynamic pricing. And
that's a shareholders dream, by the way.
Here's how it's going to work. Think
about how airports charge us like $20
for a sandwich or a bottle of water.
Why? Because they know you're trapped.
You're not going to leave the airport,
get an Uber, and eat somewhere else,
then come back through security. You are
stuck. That is a very simple form of
dynamic pricing. But imagine if that
logic gets supercharged by digital IDs.
Let's say your ID app shows that you
just got off a 10-hour flight, right?
The system knows where you've been. It
knows your wallet balance. It knows
you're hungry. So, the algorithm
decides, you know, that person is
stressed and they will probably pay
more. And then boom, your sandwich is
$25 instead of $12, but the person next
to you might pay less just because that
system thinks they're more price
sensitive. They can tolerate $15, but
not a dollar more.
Ticket Master, for example, already uses
dynamic pricing where the same ticket
can jump in price minuteby minute based
purely on demand. Now, imagine though if
your digital ID shows you've searched
for, I don't know, Taylor Swift tickets
five times this week. The algorithm
knows you are more likely to pay more,
so your price gets pushed higher than
someone else's. Airlines already do
this. Or think about car insurance.
Right now, companies use broad
categories, right? But with digital ID,
they could see your exact driving
history, your Uber ride logs, where you
hang out, all based on its ability to
digitally track exactly where you are
and where you've been. And you don't get
to negotiate any of this because the
system already knows too much about you.
That's the corporate power risk. And
then, of course, there's one more. The
third place this power will show up in
is surveillance and security. Some
digital driver's license apps in the US
already have what's called a phone home
feature. That means every time you use
your ID at a bar, at an airport, or a
hotel, it pings a government database.
So now instead of just being a harmless
ID, the government now has a timestamped
log of everywhere you go and everything
you do in real time. If you add in
central bank digital currencies on top
of all that, which are already being
tested, as well as an API that companies
can pay to access, and it's not really
that hard to imagine a programmable like
money that is tied to your biometrics,
that gives the government the ability to
program dollars that maybe stop working
at certain stores for certain purchases
or even dollars that expire after a
certain date. It's all up to their
discretion. But it gets worse when you
consider data breaches. India's Adar
system, for example, which is the
biggest digital ID program in the world,
has already had multiple leaks.
Sensitive information from a billion
people, including biometrics, was
exposed. But here's the problem. Once
your fingerprint or your facial scan or
your iris is leaked or it's sold, you
can't reset it like a password. It
doesn't work that way. If the system is
trying to protect us from fraud or
illegal immigration, then the current
system that we have today should be
working. But it's not. So an extra layer
of this identification is going to do
very little to stop it.
>> Why do you think that them having a
digital ID, having to have a digital ID
would stop that problem when right now
people are meant to have a national
insurance number and card and if they're
not asked for that, a boss is willing
already to break the rules. What's the
difference going to be?
>> It's exactly right. If they're not
willing to ask for their current
credentials, what makes them think a
digital ID will do anything to change
that? And he didn't really have a good
answer for that because there is no good
answer. So, if we allow this to happen,
I think it's going to fundamentally
change the balance of power between
people, governments, and corporations.
And not for the better, unfortunately.
But yes, it will be more convenient for
people as long as you don't get out of
line or say something someone doesn't
like.
>> All that digital ID will be is a means
of controlling the population, of
telling us what we can and can't do, of
finding the innocent. Uh, and didn't we
see it all when we had the pandemic,
when you had to have vaccine ID to
travel, to do various things? Did that
stop the COVID pandemic spread
spreading? Did it hell? All it did was
put cost and inconvenience on everybody
else. I also worry about massive data
banks being held by the government,
being hacked by foreign governments, by
private companies, by criminals. I do
not see a single benefit to the
government having digital ID other than
them controlling what we do, what we
spend, and where we go.
>> That's a crazy world we live out there.
And I swear the older I get, the more
I'm starting to become like that one
crazy paranoid uncle. And I know how all
of this sounds. And I get how it sounds
like fear-mongering, but as they say,
only the paranoid survive. But I'd love

system. Is it good? Is it bad? Let me
