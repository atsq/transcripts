Oh, baby.
>> Come on. Come on. That's a good golf
shot. I I I know it's not going to get
on the green, but I love that shot.
Cheers. And I can get that up and down.
>> Oh, that came out so nice. That may get
that back to the blue flag.
>> Came out so good.
>> Did it go in?
>> Did it go in?
Hi, I'm Johnson Wagner. I'm down here
with Tommy Fleetwood and we've got some
great tips for you coming. We are going
to talk fairway woods. We're going to
hit some shots off flat lies, downhill
lie, and may even get into the rough a
little bit. All right, Tommy, we got 248
yards to that white flag on the right
side of this par five green. We got a
couple other ones out there. I We got
the new Qi35 fairway woods. What What's
in your bag right now?
>> So, uh I have quite a lot of options at
the top end. So, um I guess I don't know
what you would call a mini driver, but
that's like the longest. And then I have
fivewood. And then very often I'll have
a ninewood in there as well these days.
I think um the way the courses play,
like ninewood's been a really good club.
>> What would be a factor for you to put
the ninewood in play?
>> Um
certain distance of shots that might be
reoccurring. Um firmness of a golf
course. I actually think a lot of the
time I think people get on really firm
golf courses and think like a two iron
is great whereas really the course is so
fast you actually might want to slow the
ball down a lot. So a 9wood and a
fivewood can be great clubs for really
fast golf courses. Um if you're going to
play in a lot of wind, ninewoods um
might not be versatile enough when you
get into the wind and things like that,
but um it's still got a lot of good to
it. It's great out of rough. Um gives
you options. So it's been um I think
it's been a really great club.
>> All right. What are you thinking? 248
yards center of the green. And I know
it's 3-wood for me.
>> It'll be uh fivewood for me. There is a
bit of breeze into um
>> but I' I'd say my fivewood is it's
almost like a really good stock yardage
for it. My fivewood's probably like
ranging like 255. Okay.
>> Uh like anywhere between 250 and
sometimes 260. So like 248 I'd be um I'd
be quite happy with um depending on
furnace of greens where you're going to
land it and then what shot shape you're
going to hit. So
>> all right. All right. So, what are some
keys? You're standing over the shot,
nice flat line in the fairway. Are are
you looking at the right pin or you just
taking it at the center of the green
from this distance?
>> It's going to depend on um I mean, in
general, you're you're always better at
hitting it on the green. Um but at the
same time,
you know, you're still 250 yards away.
Um and just because you're aiming at the
middle of the green doesn't mean you're
going to hit the green. So, sometimes,
you know, if the miss is okay on on the
right on the right side, you I might
take it more aggressive at the pin. Um,
and then yard yardage will play a
factor. Like if if I have, you know, for
instance, if I had 260 now, then the
pins on the right, I can't start fading
into that pin. I can't reach. Um, so
then, you know, but as in 248, maybe
240, I can start hitting a fade. So then
I might feel like I can be a bit more
aggressive because I'm starting it on
that left side and working it in. Uh, so
that white pin on the right, it's 248.
There is there is actually some breeze.
I mean, it's it's not a particularly
windy day, but there's enough breeze to
make an impact. So, I think I could go
pretty much stock. I would love, you
know, if that bunker was fine, like may
and and long isn't good, maybe I'd be
start thinking about fading it and
taking a bit off it. But, um, I'll hit a
stock shot, try and hit it just left of
the pin. See how we do.
>> And what what are some keys for you when
hitting a fairway wood off of nice tight
fairway lies? How do you approach going?
Do you hit down on it? What what what
are your thoughts? Um definitely on a a
9wood, fivewood, I'm just trying to
swing it like the rest of my irions
really. Um just that continuation um
like up through the bag. So you know,
seven, six, five, four iron. Soon as you
move into a wood, I would love things to
be as constant as possible. So I would
have very similar thoughts.
>> Okay, let's see what you got.
right at it.
>> Good thing we didn't place a wager on
close to the pen.
>> It was a fraction bottom me.
>> I was kind of expecting to see you take
a divot. Do you ever do you ever take
divots with uh with fairway woods?
>> I kind I I mean I'm not I'm not the
steepest golfer by any means. So as soon
as um you know I I get to I mean
occasionally I'll practice taking divots
just so I get cover in the ball, right?
Um but yeah, I'm I'm not like a steep
swinger.
>> Right. So like when you're would you do
you know an angle of attack that you
would have on a fivewood? Are you
>> My fairway woods would be where I start
to get around zero.
>> Okay.
>> And then once you get higher like my
driver will be up and the rest you know
my iron. So like fairway woods I always
find is like the point where I would
find myself getting to zero.
>> Okay. Well I'm going to try to knock
this on the green. I'm going to go with
the white flag as well. Uh really I just
hope to make good contact, but I'm going
to try to treat it like an iron like you
said.
Oh
>> healed it a bit.
>> Just a little bit drifty, but
>> and a little short. Well, we got to get
one of these on the green. Let's see.
Let's get you another one.
>> You want to hit my 3-wood?
>> No, I I just have to rip it.
Should we take it at the red flag?
>> We can go red flag. Well, I mean,
>> no, I'm going white flag again.
>> Okay. All right.
>> I'm just going to have to This will have
to be, you know, a nice flush one. Get
it a bit higher up the face.
>> Oh, baby.
>> Is that drifting? Go.
>> It's the drift.
>> It covered it.
>> It's close.
>> Have to go. I mean, that would be a
really nice one if you're being
aggressive to the pin, like if you felt
comfortable. I mean, that's just off the
green. I
>> Well, it might be on the green. I don't
know where the edge of the green is.
>> The first three would I hit that that
Qi35. I couldn't believe I've never seen
a 3-wood get up like that. Have you
noticed anything with this new
equipment?
>> Yeah, I just think I just think that's
such a an important aspect of a fairway
wood. Uh for me, as like some of my
tendencies are I I get I you know, I get
behind it, I get some side bend as soon
as I'm trying to lift something up in
the air, I get into all kinds of issues.
It brings in a two-way miss for
starters. Um, so the the easier it is
to, you know, these fairway woods, they
they what I found, especially in a
fivewood, um, it gets in the air very
easy, but it's going forward as well.
It's not like a spinny floaty up in the
air,
>> which is the worst,
>> which is the worst. So, you're getting
the number that you want out of it, but
you're just watching it in like a high
window straight away.
>> Even though I've got three wood and
you've got fivewood, I'd still like to
hit this closer than you, Tommy.
>> I'd love you to.
Little drop kick.
>> We love a drop kick though.
>> It's got to go.
It's short of the bunker.
>> It was good. It was good line. We like
direction.
>> It was a very good line. All right,
let's take us over here and we'll hit
some shots off the downs slope.
>> All right, Tommy, we have moved to a
downhill lie ball below our feet. It's
pretty severe right here. What What are
some keys when hitting this shot off a
downhill lie?
>> Um, never fight the shot that the ground
is giving you is something that um I
always try and live by. So
>> down slope balls below your feet, the
ball's always going to curve left to
right. Um so there's no reason why I
would try and fight the slope. Um I
would I would let you know I would give
myself some room on the left. Um let it
move. And then I think on this one in
particular, um, it's not that much of a
down slope, but if it was, I would I
would try and, you know, shift my weight
to match the slope, but then when it's
going away from you, you're going to get
pushed onto your toes. So, I would try
and focus on having a bit more weight in
my heels at the start, and that should
like even me out a little bit. Okay.
>> Um, and then, yeah, we won't fight the
SL. We'll go to that red.
>> So, so heels weight more.
>> I would just Yeah, I would just have a
bit more focus in being in my heels
because I'm I'm obviously the the
ground's pushing me that way all the
time. So, I'm going to try and
counteract that a little bit.
>> Okay.
>> Just as a as an even weight thing.
>> Um,
>> red flag.
>> Red flag. Going to give myself some room
to the left. So,
>> I actually don't mind. There's there's
the there's the big trunks that stand
out which are like three four yards left
of the green. Yep.
>> Um, and let it and let it work its way
off that.
>> Oh, I started it a bit left. Yeah, but
that's working right on. I mean, that's
the that's the proper miss right there.
>> Yeah. Yeah, exactly. I mean, I wasn't I
wouldn't be that disappointed. Um, it's
not it's not the shot I want. Um, but we
very rarely hit those. So, I
>> I I find on these sort of lies as a draw
of the golf ball. I can tend when I try
to hit a fade, I can double cross it.
You got anything to Is it Do you think
the weight being back in my heels will
help?
>> I I mean I mean maybe. I think um like I
Yeah. So, as a drawer, I always felt
like because you you think as a drawer,
I think sometimes a lot of the stuff I
would used to do, I would think, well,
this is going to make me hit it
straight, like it'll just counteract.
But then if you're not giving yourself
enough room that way, I think maybe you
fight it a little bit. The more room you
give yourself, it's like playing in
wind. The more room you give yourself to
allow the wind to come, you very rarely
double cross it because you're so far
that way already, you're only really
going to work it the, you know, the way
that's coming into the pin. That's what
I always found.
>> Okay, I like that. I'm going to take it
at that those big trunks just like Give
yourself some nice bit of room to the
left over.
>> Feet open with this or
>> Yeah. I mean, you just Yeah, you're
aiming up that left side.
>> Giving it plenty of room out to the
left. Weight back in the heels. And I'm
just going to embrace it like you said
and don't fight what it wants to do.
>> Come on. Come on. Good golf shot.
>> I I I know it's not going to get on the
green, but I love that shot. It's right
there next to yours, and I can get that
up and down.
>> Cool. All right.
>> I want another go.
>> Let's Let's get one close.
>> Yeah.
We need We need an eagle putt.
>> Okay.
>> It's playing long actually. The wind's
just picked up.
>> Are you making any adjustments on this?
>> Um,
>> do you know what? I actually might move
this back a little bit and try and just
like compress it a little bit more, but
everything about the shot's still the
same. The slope's still going to work
for me and I'm going to give myself
plenty of room to the left. But yeah,
that wind's picked up.
>> And the thing we were talking about how
easy it is to get the ball up with these
clubs. I think the greatest thing about
the Qi35 is that you can keep it down,
too. It's very workable.
>> It is. It's very workable. Here we go.
Let's show just how workable it is.
>> Oh, baby.
>> Oh, Johnson, stop it.
>> Oh, that was so close.
>> That was a good swing. That was a good
swing.
>> There's my divot that you That's exactly
what I wanted to see. That means you
really compressed it and flighted it.
All right, let's go see that ninewood
out of the rock. Okay.
All right, Tommy. Now we've moved to the
rough. You've got this utility club,
Ninewood. Such a A lot of players are
playing it. Back in the day, I don't
think a lot of
>> PGA Tour pros would feel confident
enough with it, but tell me why you like
this club.
>> You can hit a lot of shots with it. Um,
I like the height of it. at the at the
distance that you're hitting it. Um
you're obviously getting to that point
where you are at the long end of the
irons. Um and the ninewood's a
completely different shot to a four iron
or a three iron. So uh my ninewood
actually carries like say it carries 10
yards further than my four iron, maybe
15 when you know I'd hit a good one, but
it's it's such a different golf shot.
It's high, it's soft. I always feel I
always feel like it's like a 235 yard
pitching wedge at times. Um and then you
get into stuff like this. So like when
you know we come into the rough you've
actually hit a good driver on on a par
five. You've missed the fair by two
yards. I mean you're devastated if
you've got to try and hit a three iron
out of this. Like you can't do it. So
you're laying up. So like ninewood is
just a great option um for that. So like
you know you look at this here it's sat
down and then uh one of the things I
took so um in the last one of the
segments we did last year uh it was
Tiger teaching us his shots with a
fivewood out the me and Scotty and and
I've always kept it cuz he had this shot
and he was and and you know he set us up
to hit this punch cut with a wood and he
said just hit like a punch seven iron
and I was like that's good.
>> Best example would be like if you were
going to hit like a punch seven iron
through the trees.
>> Yeah.
>> Okay. Okay.
>> How you'd play it. Okay.
>> And just let the the meat of the club
and all the size and the weight and the
loft do all the work for you.
>> So, punch seven on.
>> Yeah. Just chop straight down on top of
it.
>> It's awesome. See?
>> Yeah. Nice.
>> So, you're hitting more down.
>> Exactly. You're going to hit more down.
You're going to get steep and like, you
know, it's it's like a choppy shot
really out the rough. It's still a
choppy shot, but the the way the
ninewood works, it just pops it out
really nicely. So, um, like that red
flag there is 225, 226, I think.
>> Um, so in here I I I would get in again.
I'd be a little bit open stance
and then I'd just think punch seven
iron. So,
>> I mean, the lie looks like that. The lie
actually looks a little bit hot. So, I
think I can get to that back blue flag,
which is like 250.
Yeah, we'll get it. We'll get it back
there.
Oh, that came out so nice. I that may
get that back to the blue flag.
>> Came out so good.
>> Oh, we got one on the green. Finally
going.
>> Oh, go shot.
>> Whoa. Good thing we were going to the
blue.
>> Did it go in?
>> Did it go in?
>> I think it may have gone in.
>> Oh my god.
>> That's incredible. Well, I think that's
going in the bag now.
>> Well, I mean there I mean there you go.
So that um that obviously came out
perfect.
I don't really know what to say, but um
I mean we were just talking before
you've never hit an ar I mean let get it
in your hands.
>> Well I shot one out of the
>> This is quite an honor to be able to hit
a club that you just hold out.
>> This might change your life.
>> All right, I'm going to give myself a
nice little sitting down lie again. And
so it's simply a punt shot with a seven
iron. That's That's exactly I mean
that's what Tiger Woods actually taught
me. So like I'm I'm going to stick with
that. He seems to know what he's doing.
>> All right. I can do I can do that maybe.
>> Oh, it came out hot like
>> run.
>> Well, I'm not It's not in the hole, but
I'm not sad about that.
>> And you can't do that with a four iron
or a five iron or a three. Like you just
don't have that shot.
>> Uh I'll be coming home with one of
these.
>> Yes, you will.
>> Tommy, thank you. And guys, thanks for
watching this how-to with Tommy
Fleetwood. Some great stuff on how to
hit fairway woods.
